<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The matter of this Report on Washington
Territory is so arranged that the reader, by referring
to the table of contents, can turn at
once to any particular topic. The report is
divided into six chapters, to wit:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, Itinerary, which mentions briefly the
places I visited, and the dates.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, A General Account of Washington
Territory, which includes something of its History,
its Location, and its great Pacific Market.
Under the last of these heads is given a large
body of facts which will surprise any one
who has not studied the peculiar commercial
advantages of our Pacific States, and above
all, of Puget Sound. There is also given
some account of the topography, climate, soils
and natural vegetation, with special stress upon
the great forests of the Puget Sound basin.
The lumber industry is next described, followed
by a somewhat full account of agricultural products,
especially those of the Great Plain of
the Columbia River. Finally, in this division,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
something is said of the available labor of the
country.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, Geology of Washington Territory.
In one division I endeavor to give the Historical
and Structural Geology of the Territory, and in
another division I give the Economic Geology.
In the latter I describe the beds of coal, iron
ore, granite, limestone and marble, and also the
ores of the precious and base metals as they
have been discovered in all parts of the Territory.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, the special interests of the Seattle,
Lake Shore and Eastern Railway are discussed.
I begin with Seattle, to show its advantages as
a terminus. I then say something of the terminal
property owned by this Company, and of
the suburban interests of many kinds, such as
residences, parks, gardens and industrial works
which are likely to grow up along the first
twenty miles of this railway. I then take up
the great timber interest along the line, which,
in its magnitude and value, will give this road
pre-eminence over all others. The agricultural
products along the line are next spoken of. I
then take up the great coal interest which will
minister so largely to the road&mdash;an interest
whose magnitude can be readily inferred from
the fact that this railway will pass through, or<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
near, five and perhaps six distinct coal fields
between Puget Sound and the Columbia River.
I next show the advantages which this road will
have in the development of the great magnetic
iron-ore beds on both sides of the Cascade Mountains,
and also the remarkable juxtaposition of
ore, flux and fuel, which are found in the Snoqualmie
Valley. Attention is also called to the
business which is likely to arise from the limestones,
marble and granite for building and monumental
purposes. Finally, I call attention to
the great advantage which this road will have,
or, at least, may have, in controlling the large
and increasing business connected with the
mines of precious and base metals, which are
being opened north and east of this line.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>, Cities and Towns are briefly noticed
which will, or may, bear an important relation
to the Seattle Road.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>, a supplementary chapter, giving latest
information.</p>

<h2>ITINERARY.</h2>

<p>I entered Washington Territory, by way of
the Northern Pacific Railroad, on the morning
of October 27, 1887, coming first to the valley
of the Spokane River,<span class="sidenote">Great Plain.</span> and spending the entire
day in traversing the plains of Eastern Washington,
reaching Pasco Junction a little after
nightfall. I crossed the Cascade Mountains<span class="sidenote">Cascade Mountains.</span> on
the Switchback, and arrived at Tacoma about
noon of the 28th, at which point I took a Puget
Sound steamer, and landed at Seattle about four
<span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> the same day. The next morning, accompanied
by Mr. F. H. Whitworth, engineer, and
Mr. F. M. Guye, I went out on the Columbia
and Puget Sound Railroad to the end of the
road, near Newcastle, where we took horses,
and reached Hop Ranch,<span class="sidenote">Hop Ranch.</span> on the Snoqualmie
River, the same night.</p>

<p>October 30.&mdash;Proceeded up the south fork of
the Snoqualmie River, and reached the engineers'
camp near the top of Cascade Mountain,
at Snoqualmie Pass. Distances by rail and by
wagon road: Seattle to Coal Creek, near Newcastle,
twenty miles; Coal Creek to Squak Valley,
five miles; Squak to Falls City, ten miles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Falls City to Hop Ranch (or Snoqualmie) six
miles; Hop Ranch to Engineers' Camp, twenty-six
miles; Camp to Summit, five miles.</p>

<p>The railroad on which I left Seattle is a narrow-gauge
coal road. Between its terminus and
Squak Valley is a high mountain spur. The
proportion of cleared land along this whole line
is not large in comparison with the forests of
evergreen timber, but there are many farms of
great fertility, some of them large. The timber
increases in quantity and size nearly to the top
of the mountain. On these points I shall speak
fully hereafter. My object in thus hastening
to the Cascade Mountains was to make my observations
first at the point where I was most
likely to be interrupted by bad weather. I
found the engineers, headed by Mr. Thompson,
busily engaged in making the location of the
railroad, beginning at Snoqualmie Pass<span class="sidenote">Snoqualmie
Pass.</span> (the
summit), and working westward and downward,
so as to connect with their finished work
in the neighborhood of Hop Ranch.</p>

<p>Spending the night of October 30 at the
camp, I went next morning to the Guye Iron
Mines,<span class="sidenote">Guye Mines.</span> which were one mile from the line of
the railroad. The outcrops of ore and limestone
lie high on a mountain, which I named
Mount Logan,<span class="sidenote">Mt. Logan.</span> in honor of General T. M. Logan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
who seems to have been among the first of the
Eastern men to put faith in the resources of this
remarkable region. I returned in the evening
to the engineers' camp.</p>

<p>The next day, November 1, I spent visiting
the Denny Mine,<span class="sidenote">Denny Mine.</span> two miles from the railroad
line, and also high on a mountain, and again
returned to camp. The Chair Peak Mine (also
called the Kelley Mine), thirteen miles distant
from the railroad, and Guye's Mine on Middle
Fork Mountain, six miles distant, I did not
visit, owing to want of time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Salal Prairie.</span>November 2.&mdash;First rain. We returned down
the mountain, and stopped for an hour at Salal
Prairie, where we found a large camp occupied
by the employees of the Moss Bay Iron and
Steel Company,<span class="sidenote">Moss Bay Co.</span> of England, who expected to
build iron furnaces on this admirable location.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
This night we spent at Hop Ranch, a description
of which is given hereafter.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This wealthy company has since determined to establish its
works on Lake Washington, at Kirkland.</p></div></div>

<p>November 3.&mdash;Spent the most of this day in
examining the coking coal beds on Snoqualmie
Mountain, three miles from Hop Ranch,
and reached Falls City that night, pausing by
the way to look upon that wonderful sight, the
Snoqualmie River Falls, 267 feet high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>November 4.&mdash;Left the line of the railroad
and went up Raging River<span class="sidenote">Raging River.</span> ten miles, where I
visited the coal openings, and spent the night
at the miners' camp. The Raging River valley
and mountain-sides are covered with large
timber.</p>

<p>November 5.&mdash;Descended Raging River valley
six miles to the line of the railroad, which
we followed to the Gilman Coal Mines,<span class="sidenote">Gilman Mines.</span> on
Squak, passing a bed of ochreous earth, which
might have value for paint, and may lead to a
bed of iron-ore.</p>

<p>At Camp Gilman I looked at all the openings
which were accessible, and observed the
preparations making for large mining. Spent
the night at Tibbett's in Squak Valley, two
miles distant.</p>

<p>November 6.&mdash;Returned to Seattle.</p>

<p>November 7.&mdash;In Seattle.</p>

<p>November 8.&mdash;Crossed Puget Sound to the
great Blakeley Lumber Mills,<span class="sidenote">Blakeley Mills.</span> and also examined
Mrs. Guye's large collection of the minerals of
Washington Territory.</p>

<p>November 9.&mdash;Made short excursions in and
around Seattle, including a trip on the Seattle,
Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, fourteen
miles out.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wilkeson Mines.</span>November 10.&mdash;Went to the Wilkeson Coal
Mines, where I found the only coke ovens I
saw in the Territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>November 11.&mdash;Returned to Seattle by way
of Tacoma, where I met Mr. Peter Kirke, the
partner and agent of the Moss Bay Company,
who is preparing to erect a steel plant; but
whether he intended to build at Salal Prairie or
at Cle-ellum, I could not ascertain. In fact, I
am not sure that he had then determined in his
own mind.</p>

<p>November 12.&mdash;Excursions around Seattle,
especially around the borders of the lakes.</p>

<p>November 13.&mdash;The first Sunday I have been
able to observe like a Christian.</p>

<p>November 14 and 15.&mdash;Collecting information
and constructing maps.</p>

<p>November 16.&mdash;Out on the line of the S. L.
S. &amp; E. Railway eighteen miles.</p>

<p>November 17.&mdash;To Kirke's Coal Mines<span class="sidenote">Kirke's Coal Mines.</span> on
Green River. By rail as far as the Franklin
Coal Mines, passing the Renton, Cedar Mountain
and Black Diamond mines. At Franklin
Mines, took horses to the Green River Mines,
seven miles, where we spent the night at Mr.
Kirke's camp.</p>

<p>November 18.&mdash;Last evening and to-day, examined
all the openings on Mr. Kirke's property,
and one opening on Section 34, Sugar-<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>Loaf
Mountain, owned by Mr. Whitworth and
others; and took the Northern Pacific Railroad
cars at the Common Point, and got back to
Seattle the same night.</p>

<p>November 19.&mdash;In Seattle working on maps.</p>

<p>November 20.&mdash;Sunday.</p>

<p>November 21.&mdash;Remained in Seattle.</p>

<p>November 22.&mdash;Went to Portland, Oregon.
I will here say that Mr. F. H. Whitworth accompanied
me on all my trips away from Seattle,
and superintended the construction of my large
maps, which were made in his own office. I
found him a most obliging gentleman, and exceedingly
well informed about the country. He
was untiring also in collecting for me such information
as he did not already possess. Judge
Burke, Mr. Leary, Mr. Mackintosh, Governor
Squire, Judge Lewis, Dr. Minor (the Mayor),
etc., were exceedingly attentive, Judge Burke
especially so. Other citizens, such as Chancellor
Jones, ex-Governor Ferry, Mr. Arthur A.
Denny (the oldest citizen on Puget Sound), Mr.
F. M. Guye, Dr. Cumming, Mr. Haller, etc.,
were cordial, and ready to do me any service.
Indeed, the citizens of Seattle, so far as I
became acquainted with them, showed themselves
in enthusiastic sympathy with the new
railroad enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>November 23.&mdash;<span class="sidenote">Portland.</span>Spent the day in visiting the
Oswego Iron Works, six miles from Portland,
in company with Mr. S. G. Reed, president of
the Oregon Iron and Steel Company. The
only point of special interest connected with
these unfinished iron-works, is that Mr. Reed is
looking forward impatiently to the progress of
the S. L. S. &amp; E. road, expecting to receive
from it magnetic ore for mixture, also limestone
and coke.</p>

<p>November 24.&mdash;Ascended the Columbia River
by steamer, with six miles of portage, to the
Dalles, where I took the Northern Pacific train
for Spokane Falls, having daylight from Pasco
Junction.</p>

<p>November 25.&mdash;Nothing could be more unjust
to the country than the location of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, which runs most of
the way to Spokane Falls in a <i>coulée</i> (or dry
river bed), which completely hides most of the
farming land from the traveler.</p>

<p>November 26.&mdash;In Spokane Falls,<span class="sidenote">Spokane Falls.</span> which I
found to be a rapidly growing city of 7,000 to
8,000 people, who are pressing the interests of
the town with amazing energy. Mr. Routhe,
president of the Board of Trade; Mr. Cannon,
president of the Bank of Spokane Falls; Mr.
Paul F. Mohr, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Nash, and quite<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
a number of other prominent citizens, called
upon me, and showed the liveliest interest in the
Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway. I
collected here a mass of valuable information
concerning the agricultural and mineral resources
of Eastern Washington; this being an
important centre of trade for farmers and
miners.</p>

<p>November 27.&mdash;Sunday.</p>

<p>November 28, 29 and 30.&mdash;Went out on the
Spokane Falls and Palouse Railroad to the
Palouse River country. At Garfield I took
the train to Colfax, which I found to be also a
flourishing place, and wide awake in reference
to the Seattle road. The citizens here were
also ready to do all in their power to aid the
enterprise.</p>

<p>December 1.&mdash;Arrived at Walla Walla, another
of the great wheat centres, where I found
leading citizens well informed as to the new
railroad, but not indulging much hope of its
coming within striking distance, except in the
remote contingency of Snake River Valley
being selected as the route of the Manitoba
Railroad.</p>

<p>December 2.&mdash;In the afternoon came south
fifty miles, to Pendleton, in Oregon, and on
the morning of the 3d started for home by way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the Oregon Short Line and Union Pacific.
By this time the earth was covered with a light
snow; but upon the whole, the weather during
my trip was pleasant&mdash;<span class="sidenote">Good weather.</span>certainly not so much
falling weather as I had a right to expect, and
no severe cold.</p>

<p>Thus I was five weeks and two days in
Washington Territory. The entire trip, from
the time I left Lexington until my return, was
seven weeks and two days. Miles traveled,
8,500.</p>

<h2>A GENERAL ACCOUNT OF WASHINGTON
TERRITORY.</h2>

<h3>HISTORICAL.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Denny, of Denny Mines.</span>The first white man who ever settled near the
site of Seattle (Mr. Arthur A. Denny) now
lives in that city, and can scarcely be called an
old man. The country remained unsettled so
long, partly because of its inaccessibility from
the East, and partly because it was disputed
territory between the United States and Great
Britain. It became a separate Territory only
in 1853.<span class="sidenote">Causes of delay in settlement.</span> No transcontinental line of railroad
touched any part of Washington Territory until
four years ago, when the Northern Pacific
passed across the eastern part of the Territory,
and united with the road along the Columbia
River, which had been built by the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company, and which had
barely entered this Territory. Following this
line to Portland, Oregon, and then completing
the road from Portland, northward, the railroad
reached Puget Sound at Tacoma by this circuitous
route in 1883.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railroad has, during
the present year (1887), succeeded in reaching
Tacoma by a more direct, though still angular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>line, crossing the Cascade Mountains at Stampede
Pass.</p>

<p>Whilst thus comparatively unknown and inaccessible,
it is not surprising that population
should at first come in slowly. Those who
came to Western Washington were chiefly lumbermen.
Since that time farmers have settled
large tracts of country, commerce has become
large, and now every interest is going forward
with great rapidity.</p>

<p>The population in 1880 was 67,000.<span class="sidenote">Population of Washington Territory.</span> Governor
Semple, in his report for 1887, puts the
population at 143,669, which shows a gain in
seven years of over 100 per cent. But the Governor
himself declares that the enumerations
made since 1880 are unreliable, and it is claimed
by intelligent gentlemen in Seattle that the
present population exceeds 175,000. It is
increasing rapidly day by day. The fact seems
suddenly to have burst upon the country at large
that here, in this neglected corner, is a wide region
offering perhaps the richest inducements
to immigration of any part of the United
States.</p>

<span class="caption">MAP OF ASIA AND PACIFIC OCEAN.</span></div>

<h3>LOCATION AND MARKET.</h3>

<blockquote><p class="center">(This should be read with a map of Asia and Pacific Ocean.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of Oriental exclusiveness, now broken
down, the Asiatic trade has always formed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
large element in the commerce of the world, and
has long been sought by the great maritime
powers of Europe, especially by England. For
this she conquered India, and seized upon many
islands of the ocean. For this she battered in
the gates of China, and established herself permanently
at Hong Kong, at the entrance to the
River of Canton.</p>

<p>In these countries,<span class="sidenote">Majority of the human race in the countries of the Pacific.</span> and upon these islands,
live more than half the human race, and with all
the barbarism of some, and the old-fashioned
civilization of even the best, the large majority
of these people are producers of a multitude of
articles wanted by the civilized world. And of
late these peoples have become possessed with a
strange desire to avail themselves of the products
of European and American art. This
market will not only grow rapidly in its demands,
but the currents of trade will be diverted
from Europe to America. In fact, the settlement
of the west coast of America inaugurated a
revolution greater<span class="sidenote">Change in the currents of trade.</span> than that which substituted
the voyage around the Cape of Good Hope for
the camel train across the Asiatic continent. It
gave America a standpoint from which she
would ultimately wrest the bulk of the vast trade
of the Orient from Europe. The cutting of
the Suez Canal mended the hold of England
and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> maritime European states on the
Oriental market, in fact secured for them the
advantage of a shorter line to the Southern Asiatic
market as far as the Malay Peninsula; but
as for the rest of that great market included in
the Pacific Islands, the Chinese Empire, Japan
and Siberia, the revolutionary movement has
commenced, whereby the bulk of that trade will
be taken from England and Holland by the
merchants of San Francisco and Puget Sound.</p>

<p>The trade of China<span class="sidenote">The China trade.</span> alone has been estimated
at $130,000,000 per annum, the greater part of
which is absorbed by England, and the annual
value of the export and import trade of England
with the Pacific Islands has been put at $75,000,000.
This already immense market may
and will be enlarged, especially in China, by
means of railroad and steamboat connections,
which will bring to the coast the products of the
interior sections. Much of the China trade now
goes overland into and through India, and also
through Siberia, to be consumed by the way, or
pushed through to the termini of European railroads
and ship-lines which are reaching to get it.
And, as the transportation becomes better, so
will the production increase. Railroad building,
until lately forbidden in China, has now commenced,
and will, in the nature of the case, go<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
on rapidly. The result will be to bring most of
the trade to the Pacific coast, and thus reverse
all the interior movements.</p>

<p>Even the capital of the Empire, the great
Peking, and the productive region around it,
have depended largely on the overland trade to
Europe, and especially on the great Russian
market opened annually at Novgorod. It
only needs a railroad from the back country,
through Peking direct to the coast, to bring
this large trade under American control. Mr.
James G. Swan (Hawaiian Consul) has written
a valuable pamphlet on the regions drained by
the Amoor River, in which he shows that there
is an immense trade "now lying dormant in Siberia,
Mongolia, Manchooria, Northern China,
Corea and Japan, which will be brought into
active life and diverted to the American shore
of the North Pacific Ocean by the great continental
railroads which will have the outlet of
their commerce through the Straits of Fuca."</p>

<p>He gives the population of these countries
as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="population">
<tr><td class="tdl">Siberia</td><td class="tdr">4,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Mongolia</td><td class="tdr">12,000,000</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Japan</td><td class="tdr">36,000,000</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdr">Total</td><td class="tdr">57,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The Amoor River<span class="sidenote">The trade of the Amoor River, Japan, etc.</span>, with its great Chinese
tributary, the Songaree, furnishes over 2,600
miles of steamboat navigation (a second Mississippi),
but, owing to a great bend to the south,
the Amoor can be reached by a short line of
railroad from the Russian port Vladivostock,
or Poisette Harbor. Japan lies on the way
from Puget Sound to the region referred to.
Major Collins, some years ago, said in a letter
to Secretary Marcy concerning this market:
"One item, cotton fabrics, might be introduced
to the amount of millions yearly; then there are
many products of these countries that could be
received in exchange. This must be done
through the Amoor and its affluents. It can
hardly be estimated what a revolution in trade
and commerce can be effected in this region;
and the fondness of the people for luxuries and
foreign merchandise being very great, if the
means of procuring them were facilitated and
the prices cheapened, the consumption would be
immense, and in a few years a trade of many
millions would be effected."</p>

<p>Major Collins thought that these people
would consume annually five dollars per head
of American goods; Mr. Swan estimates two
dollars per head. These goods would be paid
for in silks, tea, rice, furs, skins, wax, fossil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
ivory, plumbago, tin, precious stones, naval
stores, etc. It is said that the overland trade of
North China to Russia now requires for its
transportation a caravan line of 36,000 camels
and bullocks, and 100,000 horses, and that
the Siberian trade is as large as that of China.
The tea sold at Novgorod amounts to $5,000,000
each annual fair. The caravan tea is preferred
to the ship tea, which is said to be
injured by the voyage through the tropics;
another argument for the North American
route.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Swan's<span class="sidenote">The new railroad
across Siberia to St. Petersburg.</span> pamphlet, the news comes
that the Russian Government is now actively
engaged in building a railroad from St. Petersburg
across Siberia to Vladivostock on the Japan
Sea; and the expectation is general that
this imperial power will seize Corea so as to
bring the terminus of her railroad to Ninsen at
the south point of Corea. All the great trade
which will thus be developed is in addition to
the existing trade of China and the Islands, and
will probably swell the China, Japan and Russian
trade to over $200,000,000, to which is to
be added the Australian and Island trade, which
already is, no doubt, over $100,000,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The American Pacific States
have decisive advantages over all others in controlling
the Pacific trade.</span>Now comes the practical question, Who are to
handle this vast trade of $300,000,000 annually?
No one nation exclusively, of course. The
Dutch and other small powers will have a little
of it; but the only contest will be between England
and the American Pacific Coast. England
has the lion's share now, but this great nation
will hereafter labor under too many disadvantages
in its contest with America. America has
the needful capital, material, pluck and energy,
and enjoys certain decisive advantages, as, for
example&mdash;1. In distance, which of itself would
in this case decide the matter; 2. In the local
production of certain staple articles which will
be in great demand, and which England cannot
supply so cheaply, if at all, such as lumber,
meats, flour, canned goods, cheap cottons, and
agricultural and other machinery, which, if not
cheaper, can be more readily adapted to the
wants of the market; 3. In possessing the back
country of Eastern America, whereby the entire
United States become tributary both ways
to the Pacific commerce; to which may be added,
4. The ever-flowing river in the Pacific Ocean,
flowing in a circle from Japan to the American
coast and back&mdash;the famous Kuro Shiwo, or
Japanese current; a current which gives a gain
to every ship of twenty miles a day in distance;
the current which brings the disabled Japanese
junks to the American coast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>The half-way point on the Pacific side between
America and England is the Malay Peninsula.
This leaves even Australia and all of
Oceanica<span class="sidenote">Advantage in distances.</span> nearer to us than to England, and all
of China, Japan and Siberia thousands of miles
nearer to us. Hong Kong and Canton are the
English headquarters in China, and yet our Pacific
coast is 5,000 miles nearer to these than
England is. It is also 6,500 miles nearer to
Shanghai, which is a more important port than
Canton, because of its greater nearness to the
rice and tea producing sections. The advantages
are still greater in respect to Peking, Japan,
Vladivostock, the terminus of the projected
Russian railway, and the entire country
drained by the Amoor. Our commerce is now
within thirty days of the coast of China, and
will be in less than ten days when the fast
mail and express and passenger steamers are
launched. I insert a table of distances, which
is full of significance.</p>

<p>By this it will be seen that New York, by
way of Puget Sound, is 1,400 miles nearer to
Canton than Liverpool is, and nearly 4,000
miles nearer to Shanghai. Mr. Swan makes the
distance from the Pacific coast less than I have
given. It should also be noted that Puget
Sound has the advantage of distance over San
Francisco also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Puget Sound has also the advantage over all
competitors<span class="sidenote">Advantage in productions.</span> of being able to produce a large
bulk of the materials for commerce in its own
vicinity. In this report there will be a large array
of facts concerning the present and future
productions of Washington Territory, which will
amply confirm and illustrate the above statement.
The only real competitor of Puget
Sound on the American coast is British Columbia,
but British Columbia cannot vie with
Washington Territory in the production of the
materials of commerce, and Canada at large
furnishes no such background as the United
States.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Coastwise trade.</span>It will, of course, not be overlooked, that in
the great coastwise trade which the Pacific
States have and must always have with each
other, they will minister to each other's prosperity.
And here it will be shown that Puget
Sound will have the advantage in supplying the
wants of others.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">South American trade.</span>In addition to these is the foreign trade along
the coast of British Columbia, Mexico, Central
America, and all the Pacific States of South
America. Chili is a prosperous State. She has
nearly doubled the volume of her trade in ten
years. From 1874 to 1883 her exports went
up from $32,000,000 to $73,000,000, and her
imports from $35,000,000 to $50,000,000. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
United States imports over $4,000,000 of goods
from the Pacific side of South America, and exports
about $8,000,000 to these states. England,
however, gets the most of the West South
American trade, so that here again we must enter
the lists with Britannia. Already the contest
has begun, and our Pacific States must bear
off the palm sooner or later.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Large existing trade.</span>Thus it is evident that a vast field of commercial
enterprise is wide open to the people
of Washington Territory as well as to
Oregon and California. And our commercial
statistics show what handsome progress
has already been made. Taking both exports
and imports, there is already a business of
$80,000,000 done by the seven Pacific ports of
entry. San Francisco is now far ahead of the
others, and this city has nothing to fear from
any other port except Puget Sound, which will
gain upon her rapidly and ultimately surpass
her. Washington Territory has all that California
has on which to trade, and a great deal besides;
and has the advantage of position. When
our commercial statistics were made up, Puget
Sound had no direct railroad communication
with her own back country east, much less a
transcontinental line. A very different story
will be told a few years hence. I here insert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a table of summaries which show that the commercial
revolution is now in operation.</p>

<p>In the latest report to which I have access,
San Francisco is the only one of the Pacific
ports mentioned separately.</p>

<p>Much of the exports above reported to the
credit of Oregon really came down the Columbia
River from the eastern part of Washington
Territory; and the great bulk of the exports
from San Francisco consists of wheat, flour, and
other breadstuffs, an item in which Washington
Territory can surpass all competitors. The following
table shows the principal items of export
from the Pacific ports.</p>

<p>Let it be noted that in respect to the production
of the larger items, to wit, wheat and flour,
wood and its manufactures, animals, iron and
steel and their manufactures, machinery of all
sorts, fish, etc., Washington Territory can surpass
all competitors.</p>

<h3>TOPOGRAPHY OF WASHINGTON TERRITORY.</h3>

<p>Washington Territory will make one of the
largest States of the Union. It is larger than
England and Wales combined, as will be seen
by the following table:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="topography">
<tr><td class="tdl">Washington Territory</td><td></td><td class="tdl">66,880</td><td class="tdl">square</td><td class="tdl">miles.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">New York</td><td></td><td class="tdl">47,620</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdc">"</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Virginia</td><td></td><td class="tdl">40,125</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdc">"</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">England and Wales</td><td></td><td class="tdl">58,320</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdc">"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The shape of the Territory is regular, having
the general form of a parallelogram, with its
longer axis running east and west. Its relief is
simple. Along the Pacific coast runs the Coast
Range of mountains from the mouth of the Columbia
River to the Straits of Juan de Fuca. In
this range there is only one practicable opening
from the interior, which is the trough of the
Chehalis River, which terminates in Gray's
Harbor. The bar here, as at the mouth of
Columbia River, forms a serious obstruction
to the entrance of vessels drawing more than
twenty feet of water.</p>

<p>Sixty miles east of the Coast Range, and
parallel to it, runs the Cascade Range, which
divides the Territory by a north and south line.
It is a lofty range, presenting a serrated outline,
whose lower depressions are 3,000 to 4,000 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
above tide, while summits of 5,000 to 8,000 feet
are common; and at intervals still higher peaks
raise their snow-covered heads from 8,000 to
14,500 feet.</p>

<p>Between the Cascade Mountains and the
Coast Range lies Puget Sound, with its outlet
through the Strait of Fuca. South of this
sound, and on each side, are wide spaces of flat
and rolling country, with numerous and somewhat
disconnected mountains of comparatively
small size, though some of them rise as high as
1,500 feet. These mountains show many natural
terraces, which may be the result of land-slides.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Puget Sound.</span>The Puget Sound basin is exceedingly well
supplied with streams and lakes; whilst the
Sound itself, with its sheltered position, its
deep water, and indented shore-line, is one of
the most interesting and valuable inland bodies
of water in the world. It has a broad outlet to
the ocean. Lake Washington<span class="sidenote">Lake Washington.</span> is a beautiful
and navigable sheet of water. There are numerous
other lakes scattered over the Territory,
enlivening its scenery and often affording convenient
waterways. Quite a number of the
rivers emptying into Puget Sound are partially
navigable for small steamers. The rivers and
creeks generally have bottom-lands, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>sometimes narrow, and sometimes wide.
Cowlitz River flows south into the Columbia
River. It has fine bottom-lands, and its
valley may be regarded as a prolongation and
complement of the Willamette Valley, Oregon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">West Washington and East Washington.</span>All the country lying west of the crest-line
of the Cascade Mountains is known as West
Washington, and is quite different in topography,
as in many other respects, from the country
known as East Washington, which name
applies to all of the Territory lying east of the
Cascade axis.</p>

<p>East Washington is a rectangular plateau, set
in a frame of mountains, and drained by the
Columbia River and its tributaries. The Cascade
Range being the west side of the frame,
the north side is formed by irregular spurs which
run out at right angles from the Cascade Mountains
along the Canada border, and connect with
the Cabinet Mountains. The east side of the
frame is in Idaho, and consists chiefly of the
C&#339;ur d'Alene Mountains. On the south lie
the Blue Mountains, which are partly in Washington
Territory, but chiefly in Oregon. The
mountains on the north have a few peaks 5,000
to 9,000 feet high, and many of the dividing
ridges are high, steep and rugged. Much of
the region is described, however, as high plateau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
country, dotted over with small, conical mountains.
It abounds in streams of water, generally
small. A strip of arable land runs on the east
side of the Columbia River from the mouth
of the Spokane River to the mouth of the
Colville River and the valleys of Colville and
the Little Spokane River are highly spoken of
as agricultural regions. The elevation of these
river valleys is from 1,200 to 1,600 feet above
tide-water.</p>

<p>Passing to the east side, we find the plateau
country at its north corner extending to the
Idaho line where the foot-hills of the Rocky
Mountains begin, and soon rise into the <span class="sidenote">C&#339;ur d'Alene Mountains.</span>C&#339;ur
d'Alene Mountains, which&mdash;being the local
name for part of the Bitter Root Range&mdash;is a
part of the western branch of the Rocky Mountains.
The C&#339;ur d'Alene River and Lake belong
to the Columbia River basin, and are so
naturally connected in mining and trading interests
with Washington Territory, that in another
connection I shall have much to say of the
C&#339;ur d'Alene country, as also of the Colville
country, and other parts of the mountain rim.
South of the C&#339;ur d'Alene Lake the plateau
country extends far into Idaho, and gives to that
State its best farming lands.</p>

<p>The Blue Mountains which mark the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
limit of the plateau in Washington Territory do
not extend more than half-way across the plain,
leaving a long projection of the plateau to extend
southward into Oregon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Great Plateau.</span>The shape of the plateau in Washington Territory
is an irregular square with a diameter
each way of about 150 miles. Followed into
Idaho and Oregon, the diameters would reach
200 miles. Its surface is generally smooth, but
there are frequent patches of rock, and sometimes
large areas are roughened by rocky outcrops.
The plateau is elevated and rolling, rising
from 1,000 to 3,000 feet above the surface
of Columbia River. Its elevations usually are
mere swells, except along the precipitous edges
of coulées. I know of only one mountain upon
it, and that is quite a small one; but it served
as a refuge for Lieutenant Steptoe and his handful
of soldiers when attacked by the Indians;
and hence is called Steptoe Butte. The surface
of the plain is scarred in a number of places
with coulées<span class="sidenote">Coulées.</span>, or dry river-beds, which are cut
down twenty to one hundred feet, and sometimes
more, and their sides are usually marked
by bluffs, often of rock. These coulées are an
advantage, or a disadvantage, in road-making,
according to whether the road goes with, or
across, the coulée. The Northern Pacific Rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>road
found it convenient to use one of them for
a long distance. The deepest cuts in the plateau
are made by its rivers. Of these the Columbia
is chief. This river, as already intimated,
has cut a channel for itself along the north and
west edge of the plain from 1,000 to 2,000 feet
below the general level. The Snake River,
which is the largest affluent of the Columbia,
has numerous branches, all cut deep into the
basalt which underlies the plain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Columbia and Snake Rivers.</span>The Columbia and Snake are both steamboat
rivers, but navigation is interrupted by rocky
rapids, which prevent through lines of steamers.
The Columbia is one of the largest rivers in the
world, and has abundant water for steamboats
from its mouth to a point in Canada, north of
Farwell, where it is crossed by the Canadian
Pacific Railway, and steamboats run at intervals
to the most northerly point; and there are navigable
stretches not yet used for boats which will
have steamers in connection with future railroads.
The steamers on Snake River are very
useful, and run to Lewiston, in Idaho, and perhaps
further.</p>

<p>This plateau, or Great Plain of the Columbia,
as it is called sometimes, is a most interesting
and important region, concerning which I shall
have much to say under subsequent heads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<h3>CLIMATE.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Climate of Washington Territory.</span>Climate is a matter of temperature, moisture
and atmospheric dynamics. The general law of
temperature is that the farther north the colder
the weather; and yet currents of water and prevailing
winds may give to the country a climate
geographically belonging to quite a different
latitude. We know how this is with England,
which, judged by latitude, ought to be colder
than Maine, but which, in fact, has one of the
mildest and most equable climates in the world.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>England is farther north than Washington
Territory, which latter is in the latitude of
France; but it is also in the latitude of Montana,
Dakota and Maine, States remarkable for
sudden changes and for terrible cold. But it
is well known that our Pacific States, at least
on their western borders, have a temperature
free from extremes in both summer and winter.
Taking July and January as the hottest and
coldest months, it will be found that the average
temperature at San Francisco and Puget
Sound is from 7&#176; to 14&#176; cooler than it is in the
Rocky Mountains and in New England during
the same months. And on the other hand,
taking January as the coldest month, we find
that Bismarck, Denver, New England, etc., are
30&#176; to 40&#176; colder than the points on the Pacific.
In other words, that the range of the thermometer
between extremes averages near 50&#176; more
in the East than it does in the West in the localities
named; a very great difference when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
consider comfort, health, cost of living, and
opportunity to labor in the open air.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mild and equable.</span>This greater mildness and equability of temperature
on the Pacific Coast is to be ascribed
to the winds and currents of the great ocean.
During the summer the winds come from the
northwest, and during the winter from the
southwest and south. Much influence in tempering
the cold of winter is ascribed also to
the Japan Current, mentioned under a former
head. It does for the Pacific Coast what the
Gulf Stream does for England.</p>

<p>The same causes regulate also the rainfall
on the Pacific Coast. In one respect there is
the same peculiarity along the whole coast,
namely, dry summers and, comparatively, wet
winters. There is, however, a gradual increase
in the amount of rainfall northward from San
Diego to Sitka; so that when we reach Washington
Territory we do not find the excessive
dryness which characterizes the summer climate
of California.</p>

<p>The figures of different authorities do not
agree exactly as to<span class="sidenote">Rainfall.</span> the precipitation on the
Pacific Coast: for example, in the older volume
on Rain Tables, published by the Smithsonian
Institution, the annual rainfall and melted
snow on Puget Sound, measured at Steilacoom,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
near Olympia, from 1849 to 1867, amounted to
43.98 inches. Governor Semple, however, gives
from Sergeant McGovern, in charge of the station,
a total of 53.89 inches annually, measured
at Olympia from 1878 to 1886. But I find in
the report of the chief signal officer to the War
Department for 1884, that the average from
July 1, 1877, to December, 1883, for Olympia,
was 62.81 inches. This difference of nine
inches is partly accounted for by the fact that
the precipitation in the subsequent years not
included in the report of the Signal Service
Bureau, namely, 1884, 1885 and 1886, averaged
only 41.88 inches, which would, in great measure,
relieve the discrepancy. It will probably turn
out on further observation that 53 inches is
about the total annual rainfall for Puget Sound.
But according to the report of the chief signal
officer for 1884, we have the following annual
totals: San Diego, 9.40; San Francisco, 23.32;
Portland, Oregon, 54.16; Puget Sound, 62.81;
Sitka, Alaska, 97.28 inches.</p>

<p>Comparing these with points farther east, we
have Bismarck, Dakota, 21.35; Denver, 14.97;
Sandusky, Ohio, 41.43; New Haven, Connecticut,
51.55; Norfolk, Virginia, 52.14 inches.</p>

<p>The value of rainfall depends more on its
distribution among the months than on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
annual aggregate. England has but 25 inches
rain per annum, but it comes at such times as
makes it most effective. The rains on the
Pacific Coast are not distributed in the most
favorable way for agriculture&mdash;the summers
being too dry. At San Diego there is less
than one-third of an inch in the three summer
months, and still less at San Francisco. On
Puget Sound, for that time, the fall is 2.57.
In Washington Territory the spring rains are
as abundant as in the Atlantic States, and the
summer breezes seem laden with moisture.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">No blizzards or cyclones.</span>In respect to cold waves, winds and storms,
Washington Territory is singularly favored.
There is nothing to correspond with the blizzards,
northers, hurricanes and cyclones which
trouble some other States. Even ordinary
thunder-storms are rare. The climate of East
Washington<span class="sidenote">Differences between East
and West Washington.</span> is different from that of West
Washington, and yet, when compared with
that of Montana and Dakota, it will be seen
that it is really transitional and intermediate
between the climates on each side. The range
of thermometer from the heat of July to the
cold of January is, at Bismarck, 65&#176;; at Spokane
Falls, 45&#176;, and on Puget Sound, 22&#176;.
And, in like manner, the amount of rain is intermediate
between the heavy rainfall of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
Sound and the lighter rains of the Rocky
Mountain country. The explanation of this
is, that while the Cascade Range, like all high
mountains, condenses the moisture of the air
on the windward side and changes its temperature,
yet this range is not sufficiently high and
cold to have the effect of the Himalayas or
the Andes in depriving the leeward lands of
rain.</p>

<p>The mountain rim of the plateau country has
not the moisture which distinguishes the west
side of the Cascade, and it varies in its amount
at different places.</p>

<p>Some statements have already been made in
reference to the dryness and summer heat of
the Yakima Valley on the east flank of the
main mountain. The mountains running along
the Canada line have probably a better summer
climate than the east side of the main
mountain. I do not know how it is with the
C&#339;ur d'Alene and Blue Mountains, but the
climate of the plateau has no unusual character
in the matter of temperature. Half of the
States of the Union have as great or greater
extremes; but the plateau has less than half the
precipitation of Puget Sound, as shown in the
tables given on pages 56 and 57. And the rainfall
in the summer is so scant that one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
not, <i>a priori</i>, expect any form of vegetation
to progress at all. These meteorological phenomena
render almost unaccountable the facts
of agriculture, which will be given hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Chinook wind.</span>The Chinook wind, which springs up in winter
and melts the snow on the plateau, and to
some extent in the mountains, is simply a
southerly wind, such as is common in the Mississippi
Valley and even on the Atlantic seaboard.
In the Pacific States it does not, from
the descriptions, appear to differ from the
breezes of the coast, except in its greater
strength and steadiness. I heard an intelligent
gentleman, residing in Spokane Falls, say that
he thought the Chinook was a disadvantage in
winter, as it caused a disagreeable thaw, and so
relaxed the human system as to render it more
sensitive to cold; but generally the Chinook is
enjoyed in East Washington.</p>

<h3>SOILS.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Soils all fertile.</span>The arable soils of Washington Territory, so
far as I could see, or otherwise learn, may be
classified as follows, to wit: <i>a.</i> Humus; <i>b.</i> Alluvium;
<i>c.</i> Drift; <i>d.</i> Loam; <i>e.</i> Basalt.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Humus.</span> In West Washington the whole
country is top-dressed with vegetable mould,
derived obviously from the heavy growth which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
has covered the surface for ages. Of course
there are bare spots, and where the growth has
been light, the top-dressing is thin; but the
mountain sides, the hills, and notably the low
grounds, are overlaid from one to ten inches,
and often much more, with this vegetable
mould.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Alluvium.</span> This includes the transported
matter of the bottom-lands, the swales, and the
tidal flats. Here we have humus, not only as a
top-dressing, but also intermixed, and sometimes
constituting a large proportion of the soil for
a considerable depth. No land could be richer
than this, and its relative proportion to the
whole is larger than would be inferred even
from the great number of streams, for it includes
the lowlands about Puget Sound and the
lakes. The mountain streams have, with some
exceptions, but little alluvial land. There are
areas of swale, or wet bottom-lands, which may
be drained to advantage. The tidal flats along
the Sound are peculiarly fertile, because enriched
by both vegetable and animal matter, including
calcareous shells and fish bones. Owing to this
great fertility, and the ease with which large
areas are reclaimed by dykes, their convenience
to transportation, and, it may be added, the
labor of clearing the forest lands, the work of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>
dyking these flats has been commenced, especially
in Snohomish and Skagit counties, and it
is thought that two hundred thousand acres
may thus be redeemed from the water. Alluvial
lands constitute but a small feature in East
Washington.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">Drift.</span> The origin of these gravel soils is
given hereafter, under the head of Geology.
They constitute the hill lands, as distinguished
from the bottom lands and Sound flats on the
one hand, and the mountain lands on the other.
They are composed of sand, clay, gravel, and
some large boulders. Rarely the gravel predominates
so as to render the land unfit for cultivation.
Sometimes there are only clay and
sand, and sometimes chiefly clay. This soil,
though not equal to the alluvium, or to the
basaltic land, is much better than glacial precipitate
usually is. It gave all the indications
of a fertile soil, resembling the best hay lands
of Massachusetts, which have the same glacial
origin. Its natural growth is luxuriant, and
when cleared it inclines to clothe itself in white
clover and the grasses. It is said to be specially
adapted to fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <span class="smcap">Loam.</span> I mean by this a clay soil containing
fine-grained sand enough to make it friable.
This is the soil made by the slates and sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>stones
of the coal measures, and is generally
found on the highlands above the drift. It is
a medium land as to quality, but valuable for the
tendency to grass, which characterizes all the
lands of West Washington. Much of it will
make good cropping land. There is a great
deal of it. It is found high on the cretaceous
hills and mountains, often extending to the top.</p>

<p><i>e.</i><span class="sidenote">A remarkable soil.</span> <span class="smcap">Basalt.</span> This is the magic soil of the
Great Plain (or plateau) of the Columbia. And
it is found also in large areas on the Cascade
Mountains. It has an ashy look and texture;
sometimes black, but generally of ashen hue.
Rarely it is compact and clayey. There are
perhaps twenty thousand square miles of this
basaltic land; enough of itself to make a
medium-sized State. Of course there are inequalities
in the productiveness of this land.
The basaltic rock in many places crops out, as
mentioned under the head of Topography, and
there are coulées and galled spots. I cannot
say what proportion of the surface is rendered
valueless by these irregularities. The outcropping
basalt does not destroy the value of the
land; for the soil spaces between the rocks may
be greater than the rock spaces, and whilst unfit
for the plough, they may be suited to trees, or
cattle range. But, judging by all that I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and heard, I should think that the smooth land
considerably predominates over the rough. Certainly
there is more smooth, comparatively level,
fertile, productive, and easily cultivated land
here in proportion to the whole area than I
have ever seen elsewhere. The great plain of
East Colorado is a vast and beautiful stretch of
country, but it is unproductive without irrigation.
Taking everything into consideration, the
plateau of East Washington seems to me to
be unequaled in combined extent and productiveness.</p>

<p>This subject of soils will be incidentally continued
in connection with the next two heads.</p>

<h3>NATURAL VEGETATION.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vast vegetation.</span>Here the two sides of the Cascade Mountains
must again, as under other heads, be considered
separately. The natural vegetation of the west
side is vast rather than varied. Wherever the
sun touches the ground, one may expect to see
grass; chiefly white clover and green sward,
which seem to be indigenous to the country.
There are, of course, many herbs and shrubs
which need not be mentioned in a report like this.
The ferns of the Snoqualmie bottoms, for size,
remind one of the tree ferns of the carboniferous
period, though, of course, not so large. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of them were seven feet high, which is five feet
higher than I ever saw elsewhere. The Sal-al
is a low shrub, almost herbaceous, and semi-procumbent,
of brown foliage, bearing a berry and
belonging to the wintergreen family, though
much larger than the wintergreen of the Alleghenies.
The Sal-al abounds on the little prairie
which bears its name. The mosses are most
abundant and luxuriant in the deep, moist
shades of the evergreen forests, and I noticed
that the Cayuse ponies fed upon them as eagerly
as reindeer upon the Iceland mosses.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Deciduous trees.</span>Deciduous trees are rare, but not wholly
wanting. The cottonwood grows to rather extra
size. The alder, which is only a large bush
in the Alleghenies, here becomes a tree, perhaps
thirty feet high. I saw some small maples. It
is said that there are groves of oak and maple
of sufficient size to cut for lumber.</p>

<span class="caption"> A VIEW OF THE FOREST ON THE LINE OF
THE SEATTLE, LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILWAY.</span></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Larch.</span>The Larch (tamarack) is interspersed among
the evergreens on the Cascade Mountains, and
attains good size. The American larch is rather
more slender in habit than the European
variety, but it has a heavy, close-grained wood,
and is regarded as specially suited for railroad
ties&mdash;an important point in this country. It is
also reported to make durable fence-posts and
ground sills. In Europe its bark is valued for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>tanning next to oak bark, and the two are used
together. The Venice turpentine comes from
the resinous sap of the larch. The older trees
are better than the younger ones for durability.
But with regard to this class of trees, results depend
much on incidental circumstances. Larch
is one of the woods used in Europe for making
gas. These are the only deciduous trees I know
of in Washington Territory, except fruit trees.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Extraordinary evergreen forests.</span>Evergreens constitute the bulk of the great
forests, and I shall name these in the order of
their importance: Douglas (or red) fir, white
cedar, hemlock spruce, white pine, balsam (or
white) fir and yew.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Douglas fir, or Oregon pine.</span>The Douglas Fir constitutes the greater part
of the forests, but not so large a proportion as
seven-eighths, as stated in the Census report, but
more than one-third, which is the proportion
given in Hough's Forestry Report. The wood
of this tree is yellow when young, and hence
some persons make two varieties out of the
same tree. When older, it becomes an orange
color, but not red like the heart of the sweet
gum and red cedar. It is, however, usually
called the red fir. The tree yields a clear yellow
resin, which is not at present collected. Its
timber is of the best quality, greatly superior to
that of the fir tribe generally, probably superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to that of any other fir-tree in the world. The
firs shade into each other by an almost insensible
gradation, and are much modified by soil
and climate, and names have been multiplied
unnecessarily. The fir, like the larch, must be
studied in each locality in order to determine
its value. The firs of Sweden and Norway
make good masts and spars, and soft, light
boards; but the boards are apt to split and are
not strong enough for ship-work. But the
timber of the Douglas fir is heavy, strong and
firm, and well suited to<span class="sidenote">The best of ship timber.</span> ship-building, as has
been abundantly demonstrated on Puget
Sound. For all ordinary building purposes
this timber has a world-wide reputation. It is
often called the "Oregon Pine." Its growth
as a tree is luxuriant on good soil, and often
gigantic. I saw many single specimens which
I estimated at 300 feet in height and 10 to 12
feet in diameter. When disconnected, they
have the usual conical shape of the firs, with
limbs branching from the ground, but it is rare
to see such specimens in Washington Territory,
as the forests are so dense there is no room
for limbs, except near the top. The trunks
stand as straight and regular as posts set with a
plumb-line. This crowding often prevents the
full development of the trunk also, except on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the most moist and fertile lands. The absence
of lower branches insures a great length of
lumber free from knots.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">White cedar.</span>The White Cedar is a variety of the well-known
arbor vitæ of the Eastern States, but
there is a wonderful difference in the size and
habits of the tree on the two sides of the Continent.
On the Atlantic side it may, under
very favorable circumstances, reach fifty feet in
height, but usually it is dwarfish and crooked.
But in Washington Territory the white cedar is
the peer of the Douglas fir,<span class="sidenote">Beautiful house lumber.</span> and its largest
specimens perhaps exceed the latter somewhat
in diameter. It is also next in abundance and
value. Its wood is soft, light and cream-colored.
It splits with remarkable ease and
regularity, so that the pioneer with axe and
frow can prepare all the timbers needed for his
house. For shingles it is fully equal to its congener,
the cypress; and for house-facings and
some kinds of furniture it is the favorite wood.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hemlock spruce.</span>Hemlock Spruce is not so abundant, but it
constitutes a noticeable element in the Snoqualmie
Valley forests. It seems to be exactly the
same tree which so abounds in our Eastern and
Northern Lake States, and is common in the
moist valleys all along the Appalachian Mountains.
It is called hemlock in the Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
States, and spruce in the Southern. Its wood,
though unsuited for many purposes, is largely
used in the North for the frames of cheap<span class="sidenote">Tanners wanted.</span>
buildings and also for fencing-plank, and its
bark is in great demand for tanning, especially
for making the red sole leather. It is also used
for tanning upper leather and calf-skins, though
its light leather is not so good as that made
from the oak barks. The hemlock bark has
not been considered quite equal to the chestnut-oak
(or rock oak) bark for any tanning purposes,
but in Virginia the price is usually the
same. It certainly makes good sole leather.
The logger in Washington Territory neglects
this tree, and there are no tanneries yet to call
for it, but this will soon be changed, and the
hemlock will take its position, not only as the
most beautiful of the evergreens, but as among
the most useful. This tree does not attain as
great size as the two above mentioned, but I
observed many specimens ranging from four to
five feet in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">White pine.</span>The general character of the White Pine is
well known. I saw but a few of them, and
they not specially good. I doubt whether this
tree forms an important feature in these forests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Balsam fir.</span>The Balsam (or White) Fir abounds on the
higher slopes of the Cascade Mountains, and it
is so balsamic that it will receive attention from
the collectors of "Canada Balsam," which is becoming
increasingly popular for many purposes,<span class="sidenote">Large supply of Canada Balsam.</span>
especially in mounting specimens for the microscope.
Such forests as lie near the Snoqualmie
Pass will not long remain unnoticed. The wood
is white and easily worked, but the trees do not
rank in size or value with those previously
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The yew.</span>The Yew is found sparingly on the mountain
heights; but, though interesting, it seems to
have no economic value.</p>

<p>As to the extent of these evergreen forests,
they may be said to cover West Washington
with almost unbroken continuity, though they
vary in density and the size of the trees, some
tracts containing little or no mill-timber. In my
<span class="sidenote">The superior timber of Snoqualmie
Valley.</span> travels, which were, of course, quite limited, I
saw no forests which answered the usual unqualified
descriptions, except in the Snoqualmie Valley,
and here they far exceeded my expectation,
as will be shown in the detailed description,
given hereafter, of the country lying along the
line of the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway.
The finest forests lie between Puget Sound
and the crest of the Cascade Mountains, though
even in this area there are variations. And
after all the chopping and sawing&mdash;of which<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
more will be told later&mdash;the forests as yet show
but little diminution.</p>

<p>East of the Cascade Range the forests are
smaller, and confined to the mountain sides.
There are some narrow belts of pine along the
northern edge of the Great Plain of the Columbia,
which furnish a little lumber for local
uses; but these will soon be worked out. The
mountain rim lying along the Canada line is
said to be covered with forest, some of it heavy.
The Douglas Fir, the Yellow Pine, the White
Pine, and the Larch are all to be found there.
There are also skirts of the same timber along
the Spokane River. And, at wide intervals,
there are strips and bunches of scrubby yellow
pine on the Great Plain, which is, however,
generally treeless.</p>

<p>The spurs and ridges of the Blue Mountains
are thinly covered with small pines and
larches. There are some areas of mill-timber on
the east and southeast flanks of the Cascade
Mountains.</p>

<p>The flora of the great plateau presents a
strange appearance to the traveler. The vegetation
is short and scanty, the chief growth
being the "sage-brush," a dwarfish, dead-looking
shrub, with a hard, crooked stem, of no value
as forage, but which is sometimes used for fuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
when nothing else is to be had. There are said
to be some medicinal, and also some edible,
plants; but the only thing of any value is the
dry, thin, short, bunch grass which furnishes a
fattening food for horses and cattle; though
many acres are required to support an animal,<span class="sidenote">Range for horses and cattle.</span>
and close grazing is rapidly destroying this
resource. Indeed, the tract is so barren and
desert-like in appearance that in the geographies
of my boyhood it was put down as a part of the
Great American Desert. And yet, as will be
seen hereafter, this is probably the most productive
upland in America.</p>

<h3>LUMBERING.</h3>

<p>Lumbering was the first industry of Washington
Territory. Even food was imported for
a time. Logging began on Puget Sound, and
went up such streams as afforded transportation
and water-power. Steam-power soon became
the chief reliance for sawing, but water-power
will be largely used when the railroads penetrate
inland.</p>

<p>Logging and sawing are separate branches of
business, which may or may not be carried on
by the same parties. And so with transportation
to the mill and to market. Large con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>cerns
carry on all the branches, even to the
building and owning of ships.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Magnitude of the lumber business.</span>Governor Semple gives the capacity of the
Washington Territory saw-mills in 1887 as 645,500,000
feet of lumber per annum, of which the
Puget Sound mills produce 344,500,000 feet.
Of this, they (Puget Sound mills) sent 200,000,000
feet to California; 2,600,000 to Boston,
Mass.; 500,000 feet to other Atlantic ports,
and over 100,000,000 feet to foreign ports.
Among foreign ports, London received 551,500
feet, and the rest went to Mexico, South
America, China, Australia, and other Pacific
Islands.</p>

<p>Mr. Cyrus Walker, of the Puget Mill Company,
Port Ludlow, in a letter which I have
from him, says:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Vast extent of the lumber market.</span>"It is safe to say that the lumber market of
the Sound may be considered all countries and
ports on the Pacific Ocean."</p>

<p>But it may make a more vivid impression of
the Pacific market for me to give a list of the
ports to which shipments have been actually
made in the last year by the lumber dealers of
Puget Sound. This list I get not only from
public documents, but directly from the millers
and port officials:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

</ul>

<p>This is not a complete list of all the ports
visited by the lumber ships of Puget Sound,
and by no means represents the business of the
future, which will increase as fast as the mills
can be built to furnish the lumber.</p>

<p>No one without seeing it can have an adequate
idea of the magnitude of the operations of one
of the great saw-mills of Puget Sound.<span class="sidenote">The great saw-mills.</span> The
Puget Mill Company, for the first ten months
of last year, sawed on an average 290,000 feet
every day of ten working hours. I visited the
Port Blakely Mills, just across the Sound from
Seattle. There I found a fleet of ships in the
harbor, owned chiefly by the company; also,
ships building on the stocks; railroads going
out to the logging camps; a basin for receiving
the logs, and a mill, with four separate
tracks, bringing the logs in at one end, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
carrying out the lumber at the other. A high
iron trestle carried off the slabs to an enormous
fire which never ceased to burn, where all this
waste was consumed.</p>

<p>Around the mill was quite a town, in which
a large number of races and nationalities were
represented. This mill cut about 59,000,000
feet in 1887. Up to the 10th of November it
had shipped as follows: To California, 32,464,763
feet; to South America, 6,847,427 feet;
to Sandwich Islands, 1,799,891 feet; to Australia,
6,681,668 feet; to Feejee Islands, 511,815
feet; and used at home for ship-building, railroads,
etc., 2,312,000 feet.</p>

<p>The Tacoma Mill Company and the Washington
Mill Company produced the following
lumber, etc., during 1886 and the first ten
months of 1887:</p>

<p>There were other large mills whose statistics
I was not able to get in time. Mr. Walker
thinks that the cut of all the mills on Puget
Sound averages 1,200,000 feet per day; all of
which finds ready sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>I was not able to ascertain the profits of

<h3>AGRICULTURE.</h3>

<p>After hearing of the forests in West Washington,
one cannot be surprised to learn that
the agricultural interest develops slowly in this
part of the Territory. Even after the logger
has taken what he wants, there remains a heavy
mass of vegetation which is expensive to clear
away.<span class="sidenote">Clearing the land.</span> A thorough clearing, including the removal
of stumps, costs $75 to $100 per acre;
and yet this is sometimes done for hops, hay
and vegetables. But the common way is to
"slash and burn," at an expense of ten to fifteen
dollars an acre. This clears off everything
but stumps, and such trees as may be reserved
for the mill or other purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> There are fine
farms in every direction, but I had no means of
ascertaining the proportion of cleared land, or
of the agricultural population. The natural
<span class="sidenote">Demand for agricultural products.</span>fertility of the soil, the high prices of produce,
and the rapidly growing demand, both foreign
and local, will tempt to a wasteful destruction
of timber in order to prepare the ground for
crops. There need be no doubt as to the extraordinary
productiveness of the soils, even beyond
that of the same quality of lands elsewhere;<span class="sidenote">Large crops.</span>
because the climatic conditions are
extra favorable for the growth of all crops
suited to the country. There are some crops,
such as corn, lima beans and sweet potatoes,
which are contra-indicated. The cool summer
nights check the maturing of these. Wheat,
also, is not suited, though produced to some
extent. But for almost everything else the
conditions favor extra production. The conditions
could scarcely be better for grass and hay.
The scantiness of the summer rains is more than
compensated for by the long growing seasons in
fall and spring. No soil and climate could be
better for oats and potatoes. The reported
yield of these three staples would be called
fabulous if not established by good testimony.
Three tons of hay, 100 bushels of oats, and 600
bushels of potatoes per acre are above the
average, but by no means reach the maximum
on the best lands. Most fruits do well.<span class="sidenote">Hop-growing on a large scale.</span> In
the production of hops West Washington has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
become celebrated as to quality and yield
per acre. This is probably the largest of the
agricultural interests in this part of the Territory,
and was at one time enormously profitable.
Present prices are thought to leave some
margin, but not much.</p>

<span class="caption">INDIANS GATHERING HOPS, WASHINGTON TERRITORY,
ON LINE OF SEATTLE, LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILWAY.</span></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">The changed agricultural conditions
of East Washington.</span>As heretofore remarked, the agricultural conditions
change suddenly on crossing the Cascade
Mountains to the eastward; and this
change begins at the crest line, and is more
marked on the mountain side and near its base
than anywhere else. The winters are longer
and more severe, and the summers drier and
hotter. There is natural pasturage similar to
that of the plateau country, coming up to the
timber line, the lower edge of which is high on
the mountain. Much of this mountain land,
though covered scantily with sage brush and
bunch grass, is really fertile, and, besides supporting
cattle, can be made to bring fair crops
of wheat and other things; but the rainfall is
so insufficient that irrigation is necessary for
the development of any large agricultural interest.
<span class="sidenote">Irrigation in the Yakima Valley.</span>Fortunately, in the large basin of the
Yakima, irrigating streams are abundant, and
its enterprising people are availing themselves
of this happy resource. By reference to a good
map it will be seen that the Yakima River is
made up of an unusual number of streams.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>  A
group of these come together near Ellensburg,
and another group near the town of North
Yakima; and there are said to be large bodies
of land susceptible of irrigation by these streams.
The Ellensburg valley is thirty miles long, and
about ten miles wide; and is the best agricultural
section in Kittitas County. It is claimed
that forty bushels of wheat to the acre can be
produced here without irrigation; and that
1,000,000 bushels of wheat were actually produced
in this basin in 1887. Hay, hops, vegetables,
berries and fruits also do well naturally,
but with irrigation the product is uniformly
large. There are four irrigating canals in the
valley. The Teanaway Ditch Company has
one fifty miles long which can water 75,000
acres of land. The Ellensburg Ditch Company
has a ditch ten miles long, covering 10,000
acres. Mr. Bull has one six miles long, and
the owners of the new roller mill have two and
a half miles of ditch.</p>

<p>Next below Kittitas is Yakima County, which
contains a number of fertile valleys, and also
good uplands, and is well supplied with irrigating
streams, which have already been brought
into use. Two large ditches are drawn from
the Natchess River. Ditches are also taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
from the Ahtanum, which is the principal hop-raising
section. A plateau, three by ten miles,
between the Cowiche and Natchess, will all be
irrigated. The Moxee Valley is largely owned
by Eastern and other capitalists, who seem to
be expending much money in the improvement
of the country. This company has fourteen
miles of ditch.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Varied crops.</span>By the help of these ditches the people of
Yakima Valley are producing corn, which under
the hot sun of the locality perfects its product.
Tobacco has been tried also with fair results.
And the Moxee County will try the dairy business.
There is a disposition also to try improved
breeds of cattle. The spirit of enterprise
has resulted largely from the passage of
the Northern Pacific Railroad along the Yakima
Valley; but at the same time the greatest
obstacle in the way of irrigation lies in the
ownership of alternate sections by this railroad.
The Yakima Indians have good lands, and
Klickatat County is well spoken of. Sweet
potatoes, tomatoes, peaches, grapes, and other
things requiring much heat, are said to thrive
in the lower parts of the Yakima Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span class="sidenote">The Great Plain.</span>We enter now the last grand division of the
country, the Great Plain, or, more strictly, plateau
of the Columbia River. In spite of its
unpromising aspect, this is the chief agricultural
region of the Pacific States. To get the
exact boundary,<span class="sidenote">Boundaries.</span> find the point (a little below
Wallula Junction) where Washington and Oregon
both corner on the Columbia River. From
this point, follow the Columbia up to the mouth
of Spokane River; follow Spokane River up
to the Idaho line; follow the Idaho line south
to the Oregon line; follow the Oregon line due-west
to the beginning, and within these lines
lies the region which is destined to be the granary
of the Pacific States.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Early history.</span>The settlement of this plain began near
Walla Walla, where a Christian mission was
established by Whitman, the hero and martyr,
who saved this country to the United States.
Hence the most thickly populated part of the
plain is between the Oregon line and Snake
River. This region was supplied with transportation
by the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company. The largest agricultural production
is here.</p>

<p>Immigration next moved north of Snake
River into the valley of the Palouse River, and
here we have the next largest area of production.
When the Northern Pacific Railroad came in
from the east, the new-comers entered the
Great Bend country, which is the northern half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of the plain. The chief settlement here is in Spokane
and Lincoln counties, which cover nearly
half of the Great Bend. Douglas County covers
the remainder, and is beginning to be settled.
There are ten counties on the plateau, with an
aggregate area of 20,000 square miles and a
population of 52,000.<span class="sidenote">Area and population.</span> Of this population,
20,000 is south of the Snake River, 14,000
north of Snake River, and 18,000 in the Great
Bend, including Spokane Falls.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Amazing wheat crops: surpassing
all other States.</span>The great staple of this country is wheat,
though almost every crop is grown, and most
of them with remarkable results. Corn is
grown only south of Snake River, where it
yields thirty bushels to the acre. The average
yield of wheat year by year for the entire Territory
is put by Governor Squire at twenty-five
bushels, and no one who knows the country can
regard this otherwise than as a moderate estimate.
This average places Washington Territory
beyond comparison first among the States
of America, and, so far as I can learn, second
only to England among other nations. England,
by the highest manuring, has brought her
wheat product up to thirty bushels, which is
double the average of former years. By the census
of 1880, Washington Territory, as a whole,
leads all the other States. The following tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
give the average of ten of the chief wheat-producing
States:</p>

<p>The year 1886 was the worst wheat year ever
known in Washington Territory: its crop averaged
sixteen and a half bushels.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Railroads overwhelmed with
freight.</span>It is thought that the wheat crop of East
Washington for 1887 will exceed 10,000,000
bushels. It certainly went far beyond the ability
of the railroads to carry it away before winter.
The most amazing glut of freight I have
ever seen was along the railroads in Walla Walla
County. Not only were the depots crowded
to the roof, but piles of sacks larger than the
depots stood outside. It was a common sight
through the whole Snake River country to see
10,000 sacks of wheat in one pile outside of
the depots.</p>

<p>The price of wheat runs from 40 cents to 60<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
cents a bushel; whilst the cost of production on
good land need not exceed 25 cents a bushel.<span class="sidenote">Price of wheat and cost of production.</span>
Mr. Hamilton, of Colfax, has a farm which he
cultivates entirely by hired labor, and he told
me that the cost of his wheat was from 20
cents to 25 cents, and that his profit was $5 per
acre. Good farms about Colfax can be rented
out at $2.50 per acre for the whole farm. Mr.
Miles C. Moore, of Walla Walla, probably the
most exact business man of that region, farms
largely by hiring labor. He gave me the following
statement of his own operations:</p>

<p>This product could not be expected on inferior
lands, but with the working farmer the
cost of production is less. The yield of wheat<span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>
on the best lands of East Washington is large&mdash;almost
beyond belief. Mr. Houghton, attorney
for the Spokane Falls and Palouse Railroad,
told me that he had known of 800 bushels of
wheat being raised on ten acres; that it was
measured by a committee. Mr. Miles C.
Moore has known 1,000 acres to average fifty
bushels. A farmer (apparently honest) told
me that he had raised seventy-five bushels to
the acre over his whole wheat area. His crop
was harvested by the acre, and the area measured
by the county surveyor. It was all sold,
except seed. Thus he got both area and product
accurately. Many more instances were
stated to me on good authority. But there are
different grades of fertility in these lands as in
other lands, and the amount of rainfall makes a
difference also. Wallula has but twelve inches
of rain, and is unproductive. There must be
fifteen inches for wheat. Walla Walla has
seventeen, and is productive. Nearer to the
Blue Mountains the rainfall is thirty to thirty-five
inches; here are the largest crops. Spokane
Falls has twenty-one inches. Yet where
else on the earth can such crops be raised even
occasionally? I have been growing wheat for
thirty-five years on good land in the Valley of
Virginia, and I never could reach thirty bushels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to the acre on a single field; and I do not believe
that my neighbors can do better than I
do. We count twenty bushels an extra crop.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Also barley and oats.</span>Besides wheat, these lands produce barley of
superior quality, weighing fifty pounds to the
bushel, at the rate of fifty to sixty bushels per
acre, and oats weighing thirty-eight pounds to
the bushel at the same rate per acre. The
weight of wheat is sixty pounds to the bushel.
Barley sells at 90 cents per 100 pounds, and is
largely shipped East to be made into beer.</p>

<p>The wheat usually grown is the Little Club, a
short, strong white wheat; but the Little Giant,
Red Chaff and Chili Giant are productive.
Spring wheat is generally sown, but winter
wheat is probably best. Blue stem brings five
cents extra in Portland. Freight, $5 a ton
from Walla Walla to Portland; thirty-three
bushels counted a ton.</p>

<p>The wheat here has no enemies&mdash;no fly, nor
rust, nor weeds, nor lodging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Much of the land has been cultivated for
sixteen years without rest or manure, and without
diminution of crop; but the best farmers
prefer to rest and cultivate in alternate years.
By the latter system the ploughing is done in
the off-year, and the land left a naked fallow.
This is thought to cleanse the land and renew
its strength.<span class="sidenote">The soil a natural fertilizer.</span> And in some cases in which lands
have an excess of alkali, their productiveness
increases with cultivation. Sometimes the land
contains as much as eighteen pounds of potash
to the cubic yard; which fact, by the way, suggests
the possibility of leaching the land to procure
potash and other alkalies.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Quality of the wheat.</span>The wheat of the Pacific coast has 4 per cent.
less gluten in it than the Eastern wheat, and this
practically shuts it out of the Eastern market.
Nitrogen in Washington Territory wheat is 22
per cent. to 26 per cent., whilst in the Eastern it
is 34 per cent. to 40 per cent., and inferior in
quality. The true gluten is too brittle. It is
better than the California wheat, however, which
has 4 per cent. to 6 per cent. less nitrogenous
matter, and the gluten inferior in quality. But
the California wheat makes a whiter flour than
the Washington Territory wheat, which is an
advantage in selling. It should be remarked that
the term nitrogen, when applied technically to
wheat, includes true gluten, the phosphates, and
all albuminoids, and excludes starch, sugar and
water, which latter comprise about seventy-two
per cent. of the wheat. Still, the Washington
Territory wheat-grower has the advantage in
quantity per acre, which gives him a better
profit than is now made in California or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Eastern State. The price at Spokane Falls
varies from 45 cents to 60 cents per bushel,
which would give the farmer $10 to $12.50 per
acre for his crop, which is more than the average
Eastern farmer gets, whilst the cost of production
ought to be, and ultimately will be, less.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The market in England, China,
and other Asiatic ports.</span>Flour is sent to England, by Cape Horn, at
a cost of $1.30 per barrel from Spokane
Falls, and in Liverpool brings within 20 cents
a barrel as much as the Minneapolis flour, and
it is also shipped to China and other Asiatic
ports, where it seems destined to supersede rice
for bread. China raises wheat, but not nearly
enough for home consumption. The Asiatic
and Oceanic market will, ultimately, want all
the wheat of our Pacific States.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Astonishing growth of vegetables.</span>Besides the cereals, vegetables of nearly all
kinds grow to great size on this plateau. Those
requiring a more uniformly warm temperature,
such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes, beans and
peanuts, do best in the region lying south of
the Snake River, which is much less elevated
than the country north and east. And this is
true also of peaches, grapes, and other fruits requiring
similar conditions. But as regards most
vegetables, especially roots, and also fruits, the
plateau generally is very productive. This is
almost unaccountable in view of the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
after the first of June<span class="sidenote">Crops without rain.</span> there is little or no rain
until late in the fall. Whilst rain seems to be
necessary to start the small seeds, large crops of
potatoes are sometimes raised without a drop of
rain. The moisture must come partly from the
soil, which has retained the winter water, and
partly from the deposition of moisture by the
sea-air which comes through the gap in the Cascade
Mountains and penetrates the deep, loose
soil. Mr. Paul F. Mohr has measured a parsnip
four feet long and eight inches across the
top. I saw potatoes in Colfax, thirty of which
filled a bushel measure.</p>

<p>As before intimated, I doubt whether the
plateau can ever become a good grass and hay
country. For long forage, besides straw, the
people must depend upon the cereals mowed
in the green state.<span class="sidenote">West (not East) Washington
is to be the great cattle country.</span></p>

<p>For this reason the plateau, as will also be
the case with the great plains eastward, can
never carry the number of cattle that can be
grazed in a grass country. A farmer told me
it required fifteen acres of bunch grass to support
one horse or steer, whilst in a grass country
three acres are ample, and on the best sods one
acre is sufficient. Still, the bunch grass is, and
ought to be, utilized. And the areas of unimproved
land are so vast that the herds of cattle,
horses and sheep which range upon them
altogether constitute a large item of wealth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
And on these treeless plains the effort seems
to be to train the cattle and horses to live like
buffaloes and wild horses in both summer and
winter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tree-planting.</span>The tree problem will, I think, work out
satisfactorily, though, of course, no such trees
can ever be produced there as abound in West
Washington. Walla Walla is embowered in
trees of artificial growth. The Lombardy poplar
seems to have been most successful. At
various points I saw plantations of box elder,
and was told that this tree is easily grown.
The cottonwood is said to grow readily. Captain
John McGowan reports the successful
culture of locust, walnut, maple and catalpa in
Lincoln County. He says, also, that the plum,
peach, apricot, apple, pear and grape succeed:
and so with strawberries, raspberries and blackberries.
All these fruits are grown about Spokane
Falls, but I think that the grape and peach
sometimes fail to mature. A good many plantations
of trees have been set out under the
timber-culture act of Congress, but it is thought
that much imposition has been practised on the
Government by the failure to take proper care
of the trees after they were planted. The truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
about the whole matter seems to be that, with
proper care, trees of most varieties may be
grown on the plateau, but that they will grow
slowly and not attain large size. I might add
many details concerning the products of this
wonderful country, but these will suffice as illustrations.</p>

<h3>LABOR.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Good supply of labor, but more wanted.</span>Under this head I will merely say that, though
the laboring population of Washington Territory
is very mixed and has not the settled character
of labor in the old States, and though
many more laborers could find employment,
there does not seem to be any special deficiency
of this class, and the high wages that are paid
will, no doubt, bring in more workmen as they
are wanted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Wages.</span>Governor Squire, in his report for 1885, page
41, gives quite a detailed list of wages, which
shows that the rates are at least fifty per cent.
higher than in the Middle States, and double
what is paid in the Southern Atlantic States.
Farm laborers get from $25 to $30 a month
and board. Loggers pay from $35 to $40 per
month to common hands, and $65 to $70 to
teamsters. Skilled labor receives high wages,
and railway contractors sometimes have to pay
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>$2 to $2.50 per day for common hands. Servant
girls are scarce, and wanted, at $15 a
month and board. Hotel servants get from
$20 to $25 a month. Chinamen are extensively
employed for family servants. Many of
them are tolerable cooks, and get $30 a month
and board. Indians are working more than
formerly. The men "slash" the forests, pick
hops, etc. Squaws always were industrious&mdash;had
to be! The Sandwich Islands, as well as
China and Japan, furnish some laborers. The
employers are favorable to this class of immigrants,
whilst the white laborers are bitterly
opposed to them. Canada will continue to
employ cheap Chinese labor, and thus place
our Pacific States at a disadvantage, if the
present policy of excluding Chinese labor is
continued.</p>

<h2>THE GEOLOGY OF WASHINGTON<br />
TERRITORY.</h2>

<h3>HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL.</h3>

<p>I shall not say much about the historical
geology of Washington Territory, because it contains
some problems which have never been
adequately studied, and which I had no opportunity
to investigate. It is to be hoped that
the regular work of the Government Survey
may soon be extended to this important region.
Hitherto it has been neglected. A few able
geologists such as Joseph Le Conte, Pumpelly,
Newberry, Bailey Willis, and some others, have
made visits to the country on special errands;
but except the treatise of Bailey Willis in Vol.
XV. of the Census Reports, and some brief
allusions to the country in systematic works
on general geology, I had nothing to guide me
as to the structure of the country, or the age of
its deposits. For all practical purposes, however,
I had no difficulty in understanding the
work I had to do.</p>

<p>All agree that the country west of the Rocky
Mountains proper, and including nearly all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
California, Oregon, and Washington Territory,<span class="sidenote">The Western Coast regions younger than
the Rocky Mountains and Appalachians.</span>
is geologically younger than the main range,
and younger than the Appalachian country.
At the close of the carboniferous period proper,
the Rocky Mountain range constituted a separate
continent, with a sea covering what is now
the main Mississippi Valley, including the wide
plains immediately east of the Rocky Mountains,
and connecting, probably, with the polar
sea, whilst the Pacific Ocean washed the western
edge of this Rocky Mountain continent; so
that until after that period there were no Wahsatch
and Uintah mountains, no Sierra Nevada
and Cascade Range, no Coast Range, and, of
course, none of the intervening country. It is
quite possible, however, that there was a third
continent lying west of the present continent<span class="sidenote">An outlying Continent.</span>
in what is now ocean, from whose waste the
sediments were derived which were afterwards
elevated and became the land now included in
the three States bordering the Pacific, whilst
the mother continent, which furnished the sediments,
sank beneath the ocean. If there were
such an outlying continent, additional force is
given to the views of Dr. George F. Becker,
endorsed by Dr. C. A. White, and to some
extent anticipated by Prof. J. D. Whitney,
which render it probable on other grounds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the two great lines of mountains, viz., the Sierra
Nevada and Cascade Range and the Coast
Range, began their upward movement simultaneously
during the early ages of the Juro-Trias.<span class="sidenote">The rise of the West Coast.</span>
The rise of these mountain lines was
gradual and marked by reverse movements,
whereby, after appearing above the surface, they
sank and rose alternately, receiving fresh sediments,
which, especially in the Washington
Territory region and part of Oregon and California,
when above water, became clothed with
an enormous vegetation which was packed into
coal-beds, layer after layer. In the lapse of time
these all came above the surface. The mountains
grew higher and higher, attended by intense
heat in the axes of the ranges, and at different
periods, down almost to the present,
exhibiting volcanic action on an enormous
scale. At other periods, a large portion of the
region was visited by ice-floods, succeeded by
water-floods, which top-dressed great areas with
a mingled deposit of gravel, sand and mud, and
carried away vast blocks of the rocky substance
of the country, and cut deep channels in all the
highlands.</p>

<p>As Washington Territory is now presented
to us, it exhibits a scene of mountains, lowlands,
and elevated plateaus, which are full of interest
and variety. Some general account of its topography
has already been given.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;">
<a id="Fig_7" name="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/fig_6.png" width="355" height="600" alt="Lower Snoqualmie Falls" title="Lower Snoqualmie Falls" />
<span class="caption">LOWER SNOQUALMIE FALLS, 268 FEET HIGH,
ON LINE OF SEATTLE, LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILWAY.</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span><span class="sidenote">The rocks and minerals of the Cascade Mountains.</span>The core of these high ranges is chiefly rock
originally stratified, which has been metamorphosed
by heat, and perhaps inside of all, with
branches bursting out at various places, are plutonic
rocks which have never been stratified.
This is the state of things on the top of the
Cascade Range, near Snoqualmie Pass, as well
as on some subordinate peaks and ranges. On
Mount Logan, the Denny Mountain, etc., are
large bodies of syenitic granite whose age I have
no means of determining. Associated with
this are quartzites of fine grain, and extremely
hard, porphyries, and serpentinoid and chloritic
rocks of different sorts, in which are imbedded
the magnetic iron ores; and also large beds of
crystalline limestone, both fine and coarse
grained. Crossing these, at various angles, are
veins containing the precious and base metals.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The metamorphic rocks of doubtful origin.</span>Whether these rocks are Palæozoic or Archæan
in their origin, or whether they are simply
the metamorphosed strata of the upper Juro-Trias,
or the lower Cretaceous, is a question for
future study. These plutonic and metamorphic
rocks are believed to extend through the mountainous
region lying north of the Columbia
River; and they are reported also in the C&#339;ur
d'Alene Mountains. It is quite certain that on
both flanks of the Cascade Mountains we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in their natural state Cretaceous conglomerates,
sandstones, and shales bearing coal, at least in
their upper beds. The deposits on the east side
of the mountain have been much grooved and
denuded, until we find only small areas of the
Cretaceous strata on the Yakima and the Wenatchie
rivers, and the Peshastan ridge between,
with a patch of the coal-bearing rocks on the
Yakima, and another on the Wenatchie. On
the west side of the mountain range, the Cretaceous
and coal-bearing areas are much larger.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The coal beds.</span>The coal deposits of all the Cretaceous regions
of the West are regarded as belonging to the
Laramie period which closed the Cretaceous age,
and constitutes a transition period between the
Cretaceous and Tertiary. But I do not regard
this question as settled. The inferior lignites
of the Rocky Mountains, and the semi-lignites
which constitute the upper beds of the Washington
Cretaceous coal properly belong to the
Laramie period; but to include the underlying
bituminous coals in the same group may be a
matter of question. More will be said in reference
to these coal beds under the next head.
The Western coal-bearing rocks begin on outlying
mountains, standing at the west foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
main Cascade Range. These outlyers are irregular
in size, height and direction; but many of
them are 1,000 to 1,500 feet in height, and they
are found in groups, separated by denuded
spaces, from the Cascade Mountains to the
Pacific Ocean, and from the Canada line nearly
to the Columbia River. The largest and most
important field, however, lies south of the Snoqualmie
River and between Puget Sound and
the Cascade Mountains. Some of the coals
found in the most southern part of the field,
and on the Coast Range, are referred to the
Tertiary period.</p>

<p>A smaller and wholly undeveloped field lies
on the Skagit River, and another on, and west
of Bellingham Bay. Similar beds are found
on Vancouver's Island. Coal-bearing strata are
found also on the Chehalis, Des Chutes, Nisqually
and Cowlitz rivers. Whilst some of
these southern and western strata are referred
to the Tertiary period, there has been no systematic
study of their geologic relations.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The volcanic mountains and
their great activity.</span>It seems to be settled, however, that the lofty
volcanic mountains which form conspicuous
features in the scenery of the Cascade Range,
were active in the Tertiary period, and not only
built their own crests 9,000 to 15,000 feet high,
but inundated much of the surrounding country
with lava to an amazing breadth and depth.
In this region, Mount Baker, Mount Ranier
(also called Mount Tacoma), Mount St. Helens
and Mount Adams in Washington Territory,
and Mount Hood in Oregon, were the centres
of the grandest operations; and so continued
for ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>We see gigantic results of this activity in the
cañon<span class="sidenote">The wonderful cañon of the Columbia
River.</span> 1,000 to over 3,000 feet deep, which the
Columbia River has cut through this volcanic
matter in its passage through the Cascade
Mountains. This volcanic deposit consists of
brown basalt, which in cooling crystallized into
vertical, polygonal prisms, or columns, which
have been sculptured by the weather into endlessly
varied forms, beautiful, fantastic, and
grand; altogether presenting a scene, or succession
of scenes, for twenty-five miles, such as can
nowhere else be equaled on the American
continent, unless it be near by, on a tributary
of the Columbia, the Des Chutes River of
Oregon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The great sheets of basalt.</span>This great pile of basalt was built up by
a succession of overflows of lava, the joints
of which are plainly visible. The basaltic
area, though perhaps thickest here, continues
with a thickness of 1,000 to 1,500 feet up the
Columbia for hundreds of miles; indeed the
whole plateau, or prairie country of East Washington,
which is a quadrilateral of some 200
miles in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> is but a continuation of the
great lava-sheet seen at the Cascades and the
Dalles. Through it the Columbia and Snake
rivers have cut deep channels; and other,
though shallower channels, have been cut across
the surface of the plateau by departed streams.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Origin of the rich soil of East
Washington.</span>Whether the extremely fertile soil which
overlies the basalt in East Washington is a top-dressing
of volcanic ashes, or is decomposed
basalt, cannot readily be determined. It cannot
be referred to the Glacial period, as I
observed no appearance of drift anywhere except
in the valley of Spokane River. Such a
wide spread of lava is not unexampled in view
of somewhat similar overflows now occurring
at intervals in the Sandwich Islands, where lava
runs and spreads itself like water. These
Hawaiian flows are mentioned by Captain C.
F. Dutton in his report of the Zuni Plateau.</p>

<p>A ledge of sandstone belonging to the
Meiocene Tertiary is visible under the basalt
at the lower cascade in the Columbia River;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and a stratum of iron ore and vegetable matter
is found on the Willamette at Oswego, lying
horizontally between great masses of basalt,
showing a long interval between overflows.
<span class="sidenote">The volcanoes not wholly extinct.</span>These eruptions probably continued with diminishing
force until near the present time. It is
reported that Mount Hood has sent out smoke
or steam since the settlement of Oregon. The
crater of Mount Ranier was visited by two
gentlemen within a few years, and a night spent
in its bottom by the side of a jet of steam.
Such, at least, is the account given by one of
them, Mr. Stevens.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Glacial drift.</span>The Quaternary or Drift Period has left
abundant, though by no means universal, traces
of its presence. As before intimated, I saw no
relics of it in East Washington, except a deposit
of rather small, generally very small, and
well-rounded quartz gravel, thickly strewing,
and really forming, the flats bordering Spokane
River. This gravel macadamizes the streets of
the City of Spokane Falls, and the neighboring
roads, so as to make them firm at all seasons.
These gravelly bottoms are not tillable except
in a few spots.</p>

<p>The undulating country north and east of
Puget Sound is in many places deeply covered
with drift material which shows the effect of
both ice and water. Blocks of partially rounded
granite several feet in diameter are found on
the hills around Seattle. This gravel deposit is
not often found on high points, but there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
ridge in the Cascade Mountains, near Salal
Prairie, which is thickly bestrewed at an elevation
of 1,000 feet. This, however, was quite
exceptional, and may be the lateral moraine of
a local glacier. The deposit around Seattle
is not only easy to cultivate (its soil being a
light blue loam), but seems fertile. The bottom
lands are free from gravel.</p>

<p>So much for the general geology.</p>

<h3>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY.</h3>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The location of the coal-fields and collieries mentioned in
the following pages may be seen on an accompanying map.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the head of Economic Geology, I
shall describe with more detail the mineral beds
which have a commercial value, and in the following
order:&mdash;I. Coal; II. Iron Ore; III.
Granite, Limestone, and Marble; IV. Precious
and Base Metals.<span class="sidenote">Thickness of the Coal Measures.</span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Coal.</span>&mdash;The thickness of the Coal Measures
of the Puget Sound basin is estimated by Bailey
Willis at something like 14,000 feet, though he
admits the obvious possibility of error in the
calculation by reason of undiscovered faults.
We may fairly expect them, however, to be
thicker than the same group in the Rocky
Mountains, which measure about 9,000 feet.
As heretofore remarked, the sediments become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
thinner from west to east. Of course, the maximum
thickness is not to be expected in every
locality. Mr. Willis's estimate was made in the
Wilkeson and Green River fields, and really
did not reach the limit of the coal-bearing rocks.
The coal rocks of the Cedar River and Snoqualmie
basin have never, so far as I know,
been estimated, but probably this group is equal
in thickness to that of any other part of the
field. The difficulty of measurement arises
from the numerous fractures and changes of
strike which exist.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fifteen workable seams.</span>The number of distinct workable seams of
coal of three feet and upwards, belonging to
the measures, may safely be put down at not
less than fifteen.</p>

<p>Before considering the quality of these coals,
I will, for better understanding, make some
<span class="sidenote">Different kinds of coal described.</span>prefatory statements in regard to the character
of coals generally. Charcoal has greater purity
than mineral coals usually have, because there
is nothing in the charcoal except what naturally
belongs to the woody matter. Mineral coal,
however, having been buried in water, mud,
and sand, must, almost of necessity, have some
mixture of foreign matter, either slate, which is
simply hardened mud; silica, which may have
been derived from sand; iron and sulphur, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of which may have been in the wood, but most
of it, probably, introduced in solutions; to
which should be added, unexpelled oxygen,
which is not only useless as fuel, but which
combines with a portion of the contained hydrogen,
and forms water in the substance of
the coal.</p>

<p>The proportion of ash in coals of the same
class is usually determined by the amount of
slate in the coal, in addition to the mineral
matter which belonged originally to the vegetable
material from which the coal was formed.
In the pure state, the proportion of ash increases
as the transformation of woody fibre
goes on from peat to anthracite.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The chemical changes in coal beds.</span>It is worth while to note what are the changes
which take place in the vegetable matter during
the process. It may be described in a word as
a progressive loss of oxygen, and by this loss
the coal becomes richer, for the reason just
given. The deoxidizing process is carried on
by means of chemical changes in the substance
of the coaly matter. The oxygen combining
with a certain proportion of the carbon, forms
carbon di-oxide, or carbonic acid gas; and a
certain other portion, combining with hydrogen,
forms water. Both of these are volatile
in their character, and gradually escape. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>other
loss is effected by the combination of hydrogen
and carbon, forming marsh gas. We
have deadly proof that these combinations are
in progress in all coal mines by the occurrence
of "choke-damp" and "fire-damp," which are
the miners' names for these gases.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Deficient nomenclature.</span>Unfortunately, we have no settled nomenclature
for the varieties of coal, excepting the
broad names lignite or brown coal, bituminous
coal, and anthracite. Even the term "bituminous"
is scientifically inaccurate, there being, in
fact, no bitumen in any coal. But it is applied
to such coals as contain more oxygen and volatile
combustible matter and water than anthracite,
and less of these elements than lignite.
The term lignite is made to include a great
variety of substances, covering the lignites of
the Juro-Trias of James River (Dutch Gap),
which retain not only the structure, but the appearance
of decaying wood; the lignites of the
State of Mississippi, which are of the same geologic
age as those of the Rocky Mountains,
but which, owing to their watery and crumbly
character, are unfit for market; the lignites of
the Grand and Moreau rivers of Dakota,
which are reported to have no commercial
value; the lignites of Bozeman, Montana,
which are really valuable, but soon break down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
into chips and grits; the lignites of Green
River, Wyoming, which are firm, bright, lump
coals; and the lignites of King County, Washington
Territory, many of which are hard,
bright, steam and shipping coals. And when
brought to the laboratory, it is found that
chemically these lignites vary even more than
they do optically.</p>

<p>This want of a varied nomenclature is to be
regretted, because it sometimes handicaps a
good coal with an inferior name.<span class="sidenote">Lignite an unsuitable name for the coals
of Washington Territory.</span> It is only of
late that the Laramie or Cretaceous coals of
Washington Territory have been divided into
lignites, bituminous coals, and anthracites.
These grade into each other so insensibly that
it would be impossible to classify them sharply.
None of the lignites which I saw were as low
in grade as the typical lignite. The woody
structure was quite discernible in some samples
of the Franklin coal, and less in the Newcastle
and Green River; but in respect to the two
latter, I could not with the naked eye discern
more of the woody structure than I have seen
in some of the West Virginia coals, which belong
to the Carboniferous period. I sat by
fires of Newcastle and neighboring coals for a
month, and observed no unusual amount of
smoke, and no peculiar odor. By analysis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
these coals show a larger percentage of oxygen
than the typical bituminous coal, but decidedly
less than is found in the brown coal of Germany,
or in some of the lignites of Montana.
They need a new name. Their heating power
is not so great as that of the bituminous coals
of the same region. Their streak and powder
are less black, and their fracture more conchoidal,
but not decidedly so.</p>

<p>The bituminous coals have the usual cubical
fracture. The Wilkeson readily breaks down
into small cubes. The lignites are black and
lustrous. They come out as lumpy as ordinary
coal, and, when exposed to weather, do not
break up into powder and grits like ordinary
lignite. This is true, at least, of the Newcastle
coal.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The coking quality not general
in these coals, but found in some.</span>The coking quality of these coals cannot be
determined by calculating the proportion between
the fixed carbon and the volatile, combustible
matter. I am not sure that Professor
Fraser's fuel ratio tables are a safe guide in any
case. So far as now known, only a few of the
Washington Territory coals can be made into
good coke. On this point, however, we have
only laboratory and rough field tests, excepting
at the Wilkeson mines, where twenty-five ovens
were turning out a superior quality of coke, as
proved by every test save the use of it in high
furnace stacks, in which there had been no
opportunity for trial.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span> It is claimed by many
persons that seams on Green River, Skagit,
Yakima, and Snoqualmie will furnish good coking
coal. The coal on Snoqualmie Mountain,
near Hop Ranch, has not been studied, but it
certainly has the external characteristics of
good coking coal, and Mr. Peter Kirke made
a rough trial of it in an earth-pit with decidedly
encouraging results.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar coal is found on Raging
River, but where opened, so much slate was
interleaved with the coal that washing would
be necessary before use. More will be said
hereafter with regard to these coals; but the remark
may be repeated here in respect to the
entire Puget Sound basin, that much additional
examination is necessary before its coals will be
fully understood. The variations in character
of these are not owing entirely, or even chiefly,
to their relative ages, but also to the conditions
to which they have been subjected, especially
in respect to heat. This metamorphic agency
has acted not only in the body of the Cascade
Mountains, but all through the coal-fields,
where faults, flexures, and intrusive rocks have
occasioned changes in the original condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the coal-beds, giving results along the whole
scale of metamorphism from lignite to anthracite.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Analyses of Washington Territory coals.</span>I here introduce (on the opposite page)
a table of analyses made in Washington City
from representative samples of Washington
Territory coals and lignites selected by Mr.
Bailey Willis during the examination which he
made of this field for the Census Bureau, and
found in Vol. XV. of the Census Reports.</p>

<h3>THE COLLIERIES.</h3>

<p>I will now give some account of the principal
coal seams which have been worked in Washington
Territory, namely, those in the field
lying east and southeast of Puget Sound; and
in so doing I shall add to my own knowledge
all information from any reliable sources. Unfortunately,
the sources of information are few.</p>

<p>In the Report of Bailey Willis to Professor
Pumpelly for the Census Bureau, we have the
best account extant of the Carbon River and
Green River basins.<span class="sidenote">Authorities.</span> Mr. Willis spent three
years in his examination, assisted by topographical
engineers. He made numerous trial-pits
and borings with diamond drill, and forwarded
samples to Washington City for analysis. Mr.
F. H. Whitworth, of Seattle, accompanied me
in my excursions, and prepared maps which are
filed herewith. Mr. Whitworth has probably
more practical knowledge of the Puget Sound
coal basin than any one else. A small volume
on the Pacific coal field was prepared some
years ago by Mr. W. A. Goodyear. And
Governor Squire's lucid and intelligent reports
contain valuable information upon the coal, and
all the other interests of Washington Territory.
Governor Semple has also, in his Report for
1887, given us the latest official information.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The different mines.</span>In my brief sketches, I shall group the coal-beds
as follows: <i>a</i>, Carbon River Group; <i>b</i>,
the Green River Group; <i>c</i>, Cedar River Group;
<i>d</i>, the Squak, Raging River, and Snoqualmie
Groups; <i>e</i>, the Yakima and Wenatchie Group;
<i>f</i>, Bellingham Bay, Skagit River, etc.; <i>g</i>, British
Columbia Group.</p>

<p><i>a. Carbon River Group.</i>&mdash;These beds lie on
South Prairie Creek and Carbon River, tributaries
of the Puyallup River.<span class="sidenote">Anthracite, coking and gas coals.</span> Anthracite coal
in thin beds is reported high up on Carbon
River, near the base of Mount Ranier; the result
of metamorphism. Also undeveloped
outcrops of soft coal at numerous points on the
same river. There are, however, only three
collieries at work in this group. One is called
the Carbonado mines, which are on the Carbon
River. Three miles north, a little east, are the
famous Wilkeson mines; and two miles northwest
of Wilkeson, are the South Prairie mines,
on South Prairie Creek. (See Map.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/fig_8.png" width="387" height="600" alt="Map of Wilkeson Coalfield" title="Map of Wilkeson Coalfield" />
<span class="caption">MAP OF WILKESON COALFIELD</span></div>

<p>These coal-beds stand at high angles (fifty
degrees and upwards), and dip in different directions.
At Carbonado, there are four seams in
pairs, separated by Carbon River, two of which
dip to the south, and two to the north. At
the South Prairie mines there are two seams,
one of which dips to the east, and the other to
the west. At Wilkeson there are three seams,
all of which dip to the west. Mr. Willis interprets
this coal-field as being a dome-like anticlinal,
with compressed and crumpled sides,
whose major axis runs nearly north and south.
The Wilkeson and South Prairie mines are on
the line of the major axis, whilst the Carbonado
mines are in a group of subordinate short folds
lying south of the main line. The anticline
extends to Nisqually River, and shows two
other coal areas south of Carbon River, the coal
of which is said to resemble the Wilkeson coal.</p>

<p>The Carbon River coal-field first having been
almost engulphed by volcanic uplifts and overflows,
and almost buried by glacial drift, is now
visible only in narrow strips along creeks, and at
intervals along the Carbon River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>Owing probably to the heating of its beds,
we find in this little field the coal which stands
highest in reputation for coking and heating
qualities. There are some differences in the
coal at the three mines. That at South Prairie
was sold chiefly for making gas. The best of the
Wilkeson coal is made into coke, and is in demand
beyond the supply. The price is $7.00 a
ton at the ovens. The entire product of the
Carbonado mines is said to go to the Central
Pacific Railway. It is impossible to say what
may be under the Drift; but, to all appearance,
the amount of coal here is not large, and the
beds are sadly faulted, and pitch deep into the
ground.</p>

<p><i>b. The Green River Group.</i>&mdash;I include in
this group the Black Diamond and Franklin
collieries, the Kirke or Moss Bay Company
mines, and the Sugar Loaf Mountain beds.
This, as well as the Carbon River field, is
nearly equidistant from Tacoma and Seattle,
being about thirty miles in a right line from
each place. The Carbon River basin is geologically
associated with Mount Ranier; the
Green River basin with the outliers or foot
ridges of the Cascade Mountains. The latter
are much more approachable than the former.
At the east edge of this field, the Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Pacific Railroad emerges from the Cascade
Mountains, having come down the cañon of
Green River. This point is known as "The
Common Point,"<span class="sidenote">The Common Point, equidistant
between Tacoma and Seattle.</span> because the cities of Tacoma
and Seattle are about equally distant, and the
routes afford equally good grades from this point.</p>

<p>The narrow gauge road from Seattle now
comes to the Franklin mines, and by continuing
it a few miles to connect with the Northern
Pacific there would be railroad connection to
Seattle as well as to Tacoma. The river here
cuts through the Coal Measures, leaving the less
valuable part of the field on the south side.
The area of this field is roughly estimated at fifty
square miles. It contains all, or nearly all, the
grades of coal from lignite to bituminous; the
variety of coal depending upon the degree of
local disturbance. As a rule, so long as the
coal is not crushed, the more pitched and flexed
the rocks, the better the coal; which fact indemnifies
the miner for extra expense in mining.
Here, the tendency is for the seams to
become steeper and more broken from west to
east; <i>i.e.</i>, as they approach the foot-hills of the
Cascade Mountains. The strata in Lizard
Mountain on the south side, however, form an
exception. Here the strata are nearly horizontal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Franklin and Black Diamond
mines.</span>The Franklin mines are on the north bank
of Green River and at the south edge of what
has been known as the McKay basin, and the
Black Diamond mines are on, or near, the
north edge of the same small, oval synclinal
basin. From this basin the dips become steeper
toward the mountain, where Kirke's beds
stand at a high angle. On the west edge of the
Green River basin, say a mile west of Franklin,
there is an outcrop of lignite. The coal of the
Franklin and Black Diamond mines is bituminous
lignite. The Kirke coal, or at least part of
it, as judged by the eye, may be called bituminous
coal, though not so much deoxidized as
the Wilkeson. The coals mined in this basin
are firm, black and shiny; they burn freely, and
make but little dust. They have not, however,
so far as tested, the heating power or coking
qualities of the Wilkeson coal. Two seams
are worked at Franklin, and three at Black
Diamond. All of the seams worked are above
four feet. A number of volcanic dikes and
flows are found in and around this basin.<span class="sidenote">The Kirke or Moss Bay Company
(English) mines.</span></p>

<p>The Kirke or Moss Bay Company mines
are six miles east of Franklin, and within a
mile of Green River. They lie against the
mountain. The strike of the mountain is northwest.
The coal beds dip toward the mountain
at a high angle. There are five seams of from
five to fifteen feet in thickness; one of them
(No. 2) may be said to be over forty-seven feet
in thickness, though not all good coal, as the
details given below will show.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span> The top of the
outcrops above sea-level are as follows:</p>

<p>Some places on the outcrop rise much higher.
The base of the mountain is about five hundred
feet above sea-level. No shipping has been
done from here. A gang of miners was at
work opening the beds, with the special view
of testing their coking qualities in order to be
used, if practicable, by the Moss Bay Company
for smelting the steel ores of the Cascade
Mountains.</p>

<p>The only seam well opened when I was there
(Nov. 17th and 18th) was No. 3, which is a
large bed and shows an excellent quality of
bituminous coal. The bed shows the side and
end (or "tooth") structure. The coal is very
black and moderately lustrous, and breaks
readily into small rectangles of less than an
inch. Its coking qualities have not been tested.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>
Nos. 4 and 5 are said to be softer and more
powdery, and may possibly be better for coke
than No. 3. They have an available thickness
of about ten feet each. The details of
No. 3 are as follows:</p>

been surveyed by the Northern Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Kirke, or Moss Bay Company
property, is a section of coal land (No. 34) on
Sugar Loaf Mountain, owned by parties in
Seattle, who offer it at $50,000. There are a
number of seams on the property, but I could
examine only one which had been opened near
the foot of the mountain. It is a good seam
of bituminous coal, of the same character with
the Kirke coal. I took the following details:</p>

<p><i>c. The Cedar River Group.</i>&mdash;This group
consists of the Cedar River mines, nineteen
miles from Seattle by rail, the Renton and
Talbot mines, ten miles, and the Newcastle,
eighteen miles. These coals are in the same
river basin, and are all high grade lignites.<span class="sidenote">Cedar River mines.</span></p>

<p>The first shipment made from the Cedar
River mines was in July, 1884. There are two
good seams here, one of which measures eleven
feet. The outcrop curves from a south to a
southwest strike. The dip is 20&#176; toward the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Talbot and Renton mines.</span>The Talbot and Renton mines, ten miles
from Seattle, are on the same seam, but, owing
to faults and other causes, they have not
been worked of late. The seam is seven to
nine feet of good coal, resembling the Newcastle,
but has a bad roof, and soon reaches
water. The dip is to the southeast at the
grade of 10&#176; to 25&#176;. The outcrop curves as at
Cedar Mountain. This always bodes trouble.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Newcastle Mine.</span>The principal mine in this basin is the Newcastle,
from which more coal by far has been
mined than from any other. Its present annual
output is equaled only by the Carbonado mines,
which are pressed to their full capacity by the
Central Pacific Railroad. The Newcastle coal
is a high grade lignite, of firm texture, shining
black color, and angular fracture. It is not a
coking coal, but has a wide and established
reputation for grate, stove, and boiler uses. It
is the typical "Seattle" coal, and is sold chiefly
in Oregon and California. (To-day, owing to
scarcity, it would bring $25 per ton in Los
Angeles). It has not the heating power of bituminous
coal, but it is greatly superior to
many of the lignitic coals. Many difficulties
have been met with in the mining at Newcastle,
the most of which seem to have been owing to
the necessity for mining on the down grade, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
fall of the coal; and the mines being now 1,000
feet deep.</p>

<p>I was twice at these mines, but, owing to
the just previous destruction of the hoisting
machinery, I could not make an examination.</p>

<p>An additional difficulty was that the mine
had taken fire.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cost of mining.</span>The cost of mining at Newcastle has ranged
from 85 cents to $1.50 per ton, averaging
about $1.10.</p>

<p>According to Governor Squire, in 1884, the
beds mined at Newcastle were, beginning at
the lowest, 14 feet, 10 feet, and 5 feet in thickness.
The dip is 30&#176; to 40&#176; northward, and the
trend north 80&#176; west. Governor Semple gives
the following as the output of the Newcastle
mines from June 30, 1878, to June 30, 1887:<span class="sidenote">Large production.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>"The great falling off in the output for 1886
is attributable mainly to the labor troubles of
that year, the mine being closed for several
months; also the abandonment of the workings
from the No. 4 vein."</p>

<p>The slope has now been sunk to a depth
of 950 feet, and the mine is being operated
entirely from this level. When this lift is finished,
it is thought that several others of equal
depth can be sunk as the basin is likely to be
very deep.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Misrepresentation.</span>After writing the foregoing, I received a
volume issued annually by the United States
Geological Survey on the Mineral Resources of
the United States for 1886; and on page 364
I read with surprise the following statements
in regard to the Newcastle mines of Washington
Territory: "Considerable iron pyrites is
present in this coal, which fact, added to the
chaff-like character of the coal for igniting,
causes much annoyance and cost to the mine
from fires. Coal, or the mine refuse, piled in
large quantities quickly ignites."</p>

<p>I knew when I was in the Territory that the
mine was on fire, as I have heretofore stated;
but I heard no intimation of spontaneous combustion.
In fact, I was told that it was accidental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>I wrote at once to Mr. David T. Day, of the
Government Survey, who is the present editor
of this valuable work, asking his authority for
such statements concerning this mine as had
never, so far as I knew, been made before;
though the mines have been described, or mentioned,
in all the preceding volumes of the same
work, and were mentioned with approval by
Bailey Willis, Goodyear, and all other writers on
the resources of Washington Territory. Moreover,
that I had spent weeks in the neighborhood
of the mines, and never heard anything
of iron pyrites or spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p>Mr. Day replied that he had no personal
knowledge on the subject; but that those statements
had been furnished him by Mr. James F.
Jones, who is connected with some mining operations
along the Northern Pacific Railway.</p>

<p>I wrote also to Mr. F. H. Whitworth, of
Seattle, calling his attention to the above statements,
and asking what was the truth of the
matter. I received his reply just in time to
insert in this Report. I copy below all that he
says on the subject, which puts a different face
on the matter.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>"No, I do not think there is any of any consequence
of iron pyrite in the Newcastle mines.
Nor do I consider that the fires in the mine
<span class="sidenote">Correction by Mr. Whitworth.</span>originated in the decomposition of the pyrites.
The fire in the mine originally started in the
'gob,' close to the furnace used for ventilation,
and where the ashes of the furnace were thrown.
Therefore, I have always believed that the fire
was not spontaneous in its origin. The fire
originated in the upper water level 'lift.' But
it was led down into the second and third
'lifts' by carelessly breaking through the chain
pillar, and thus letting the fire down. Several
years before the fire started in the mine, and
about three-quarters of a mile, or a mile, west of
the point where it started, by careless mining
and drawing of pillars, there was a 'squeeze,'
and the mine heated; the result, I think, of the
crush; but the mine did not fire. While you
were out here the mines were in danger of firing,
and when the cause was not the proximity
of the present fire&mdash;but that, too, I think, was
brought on by reckless mining. Running their
'breasts' 75 feet wide and more, and leaving only
skeleton pillars, a 'squeeze,' of course, resulted,
and the crushing produced the heat, and it did
finally fire. The crushing being so great that
the top work came down to within five or six
inches of the bottom, you see easily producing
crushing sufficient to cause fire.</p>

<p>"But the coal does fire outside spontaneously,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>
or rather the slack does, when it is piled in considerable
quantities, and after a year or more of
exposure. The combustion in the slack piles
usually commences in the firing of the shaley
cap rock, which is thrown in with the slack as
the rock disintegrates, or as that process goes on
with the 'nigger-heads' thrown into the slack
pile. And yet I feel satisfied that the slack
piles fire when there appears to be almost none
of the rock or 'nigger-head' in it. Two conditions,
I think, are required: first, that the slack
particles be small, and second, that large quantities
of water be present. And I have supposed
the heat and firing was caused by changing of
the conditions; small particles of slack by disintegration
to much smaller particles.</p>

<p>"And yet it may be possible that there may be
sulphur in the form of pyrite present in sufficient
quantity to do its work. Very semi-occasionally,
very seldom, I have seen in the sulphur
streaks some slight indications of pyrite; but
generally the sulphur streaks, or balls, seem
to be composed almost entirely of sand, with
very little sulphur, and some coaly matter.</p>

<p>"The coal never has fired on shipboard.</p>

<p>"I remember that, several years, ago Mr.
Howard, of the O. I. Co., had collected and
stored in his yard in San Francisco, Cal., in one<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>
pile, several thousand tons of Newcastle coal,
and was carrying it for some time in stock, and
that he complained that his coal was heating,
and feared fire. Since then they [have not]
stowed in such large piles, nor carried stock so
long.</p>

<p>"No, sir; the sulphur that we rooted [out]
at Gilman was not in form of pyrite, nor have
I seen any so far. I do not fear spontaneous
combustion, because in the Newcastle, when
it has occurred, it has resulted from carelessness."</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement from Mr. Whitworth is certainly
satisfactory on the main point, namely,
that there is nothing in this suggestion which
need diminish the reputation of the Newcastle
coal as a stocking and shipping coal.</p>

<p>In 1884, Mr. Jones (the same man) made
a special report to Governor Squire on the
coals of Washington Territory, in which he
describes the Newcastle coal, speaking of it
most highly, and saying nothing of spontaneous
combustion. He uses the following language
concerning the Newcastle coal: "The
coal is taken from three beds, and is commercially
known as the 'Seattle lignite,' having a
bright lustre and good fracture. It is a good
and choice fuel for steam generating and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
domestic use. The condition of the coal adds
much to its value."</p>

<p><i>d. The Squak Creek, Raging River, and
Snoqualmie Group.</i>&mdash;These are not all in the
same hydrographic basin, but they are considered
together because they are the coals
which will be reached by the Seattle, Lake
Shore and Eastern Railroad. A great outcrop
of coal seams occurs in the valley of
Squak Creek in the mountain spur which lies
between Squak and the Newcastle mines.
These seams are now being opened by the<span class="sidenote">Gilman Mines.</span>
Seattle Coal and Iron Company, and are known
as "The Gilman Mines."</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Structure of Squak Mountain.</span>The geological structure of the Squak Mountain
and its coal seams is peculiar. With all
their local irregularities, the general trend of the
coal-bearing rocks in Washington Territory is
north and south; so determined by the line of
the Cascade Mountains, which is the main axis
of elevation, with numerous subordinate and
parallel axes. But on Squak Mountain we find
the whole group of rocks and coal seams whirled
at right angles to the general line. In other
words, their general direction is east and west,
instead of north and south, and the rocks lie in
regular order against their central axis, dipping
northward at a high angle, and showing no fault,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>
so far as I know, except, possibly, a vertical
fracture somewhere in the mountain, as suggested
by a change of 38&#176; in the strike at a
point about one mile west of the outcrop on
Squak. If the fracture exists, it does not follow
that there is any serious dislocation. These
coal seams are thus carried almost squarely
across the spur from Squak Creek to Coal
Creek, or from the Gilman Mines to the Newcastle
Mines.</p>

<p>The simple explanation is, that, in the upheaval
of the country, the Squak Mountain was
made by a cross axis of elevation which runs
east and west, or at right angles with the Cascade
Mountains. Its metamorphic core shows
itself along the crest of the mountain.</p>

<p>The part of the mountain which holds the
coal seams is a high spur which puts off at right
angles northward from the crest or backbone,
and continues to Lake Washington, a distance
of five miles. At the point where the spur
leaves the backbone, it may be 1,000 or 1,200
feet high, and it declines gradually to the lake,
and then makes a bluff shore-line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> On the east
side of the spur on Squak Creek it is steep,
whilst on the west side, next Newcastle, it drops
off more gradually. This difference of grade
occasions a great difference in the economy of
mining on the two sides.<span class="sidenote">Peculiar advantages for
mining possessed by the Gilman Mines.</span> On the east, or Squak
Creek side, the ends of the seams are boldly presented,
showing in diagonal parallel lines extending
from the top of the spur to the creek level,
an average exposure of, say, 900 feet in elevation.
Here the entries are being driven in horizontally
near the water level, and the future
progress of the mining will be inward and upward
instead of downward and sidewise, as at
Newcastle. The entries will all be on the horizontal
line crossing the seams. The extreme distance,
1,300 feet. The length of the seams on
the company's land is about two miles. Depth
below water level, indefinite.</p>

<p>No shipments have yet been made from
Squak Creek, Raging River, or Snoqualmie
Mountain, but active developing work has
been in progress since September last at the
Gilman Mines (forty miles from Seattle), and
shipping will begin shortly. A switch of only
600 yards in length is required from the main
line of railway to reach the outcrop of the
coal, and there is every natural advantage for
mining.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Seattle Coal and Iron Company.</span>The Seattle Coal and Iron Company own this
property, which consists of 1,300 acres underlaid
by seven coal seams, five of which will be
mined ultimately, three in the beginning. I
was able <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>to examine three seams which will

<p>The lower bench would probably be neglected
for the present, but the upper bench is worthy
of immediate development. The coal is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
good quality. Perhaps on analysis it would be
classed with bituminous coals, although the
woody structure is discernible in places. It
burns freely. The outcrop of this bed is visible
lower down the creek in a crushed condition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Large body of valuable coal.</span>My visit was rather premature for a proper
study of the group; but there can be no doubt
that there is here a large body of valuable coal.
The quantity is estimated by the mining engineer,
Mr. Whitworth, at 10,500,000 tons. I
saw no other coal beds in the territory so favorably
situated for mining and loading. Of course,
coal standing at an angle of forty degrees cannot
be mined so cheaply as if it were horizontal;
but all the mines in Washington Territory must
contend with this disadvantage, and in all cases
coming under my observation, except this one,
the mining had to be done on the down grade,
which involved much hoisting, pumping, bad
air, etc., which can be avoided at the Gilman
Mines.</p>

<p>An incidental advantage, also, is that the
Squak Valley furnishes any amount of timber
for building, propping, railroad ties, etc., and
when more generally cultivated, a superabundance
of agricultural products. The experience
of Newcastle, and the rapid growth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
market, indicate that these mines may be enlarged
in their operations, almost without limit.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Washington Mines.</span>Washington Mines, on one of the upper
branches of Squak Creek, show the outcroppings
of three seams of lignite coal, dipping S. of W.
I did not visit this place, but was informed that a
company, known as the Washington Coal Company,
was engaged in cutting these seams; but
I am not informed as to what are their prospects.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Raging River coals.</span>The Raging River Coals. Six miles east of
Gilman Mines, where the railroad enters the
Raging River Valley, is found another group of
coal seams, older than the Squak coals, and perhaps
corresponding in age with the Franklin and
Black Diamond coals, though apparently more
bituminous than they. Raging River is about
twelve miles long, and the railroad first approaches
it about midway its length. There
are indications of local metamorphism, if not
intrusion, visible in the rocks between Squak
Creek and Raging River, and this is further
indicated by an outcrop of anthracite at the
north end of the coal seams, within a mile of
the road. Mr. Whitworth represents this anthracite
seam as five feet thick, but crushed
and fragile. Its structure is laminated, and it
breaks into small cubes. He spoke, also, of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>
another seam of anthracite high up on Raging
River, three feet thick, with three inches slate
six inches from the top. He mined in on this
for thirty feet without observing any change.
The outcrop of this group of coal seams extends
from near the line of the railroad, up the west
side of the valley, parallel with the river, and
about a mile from it, and lying in high hills.
This coal property is also owned by the Seattle
Coal and Iron Company. The principal mining
camp is near the head of the valley, ten
miles above Falls City, six miles above the line
of railway. Here I saw the coal seams, which
had been uncovered without having been cut
into sufficiently to determine fully their character.
One seam is open in a ravine, half way up
the mountain, but most of them near the top,
at an elevation of about 800 feet above the
river. There are at least six seams, and if the
one on the mountain side be a different seam,
there are seven. The coal generally is of good
quality: bituminous, with cubical fracture; but
its value is greatly diminished by numerous
slate partings, and some of the seams are
too thin for profitable mining. The dip is to
the southwest at high angles: about eighty
degrees on the mountain side&mdash;less in the top
seams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Details.</span>The seam on the mountain side showed a
total thickness of seven feet with sandstone over
and under; but of this there was only about 2
feet 8 inches of good coal in a body, and the
rest coal and slate interleaved. Near the top
of the mountain there are six seams open near
a rivulet, and quite near together. Reaching
the top of the mountain, I found the upper
opening (geologically the under opening), No.
1, to contain about two feet of good black
coal, with one slate parting of an inch thick.</p>

<p>No. 2. This seam shows a total thickness of
eight feet, but it contains so many slate partings
that I could not estimate the bed highly.</p>

<p>No. 3. Here I saw fifteen inches of coal, with
slate partings.</p>

<p>No. 4. An irregular bed, four to seven feet
in thickness, crushed, and probably dislocated,
and so slaty as to be of doubtful value.</p>

<p>No. 5. Another crushed and irregular exposure,
four to six feet thick. The coal looks
better, and promises to be a good seam when
found in its natural state.</p>

<p>No. 6. A two-foot seam resembling No. 1.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth furnished me the following
details of an opening near the camp on Raging
River, which was not in a condition to be seen
during my visit, but which has since been gone<span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>

<p>Mr. Whitworth says that the coal improved
as he went in, and he is quite hopeful about this
seam. But his record reads to me like the description
of a slide; still it may not be so.</p>

<p>The show upon the whole, as seen by me,
was not satisfactory&mdash;and yet the beds might
possibly improve inward; and if the coal should
coke well, it might pay to wash it; as could
easily be done at Raging River.</p>

hundreds of feet up the west side of Snoqualmie

<p><span class="sidenote">Details.</span>Seam No. 3 is the third seam from the bottom.
A side entry had been driven in on the
coal for 60 feet, but water now barred the entrance
and prevented a thorough scrutiny of the
seam. Its thickness was about 3 feet 6 inches,
of which there was a band of lignitic coal of
three-quarters of an inch near the top, and five
inches of the same near the bottom. The weathered
outcrop of this, as of the coal-beds of
Washington Territory generally, had a brownish
hue, but the fresh surfaces showed a good black
bituminous coal. It lies firm and regular in its
bed. When dug and handled, it goes to small
pieces, and may generally be crushed to powder
in the hand; which, of itself, is no bad sign of
a good coking coal.</p>

<p>The coal of this seam is soft, black and lustrous.
An entry was driven in 50 feet, which
required much propping, the roof being bad.
At the end of this distance we came squarely
against a wall of sandstone, showing a fault.
At this point six inches of the top coal is thrown
up vertically, which showed that the seam thus
far had dropped, and that the continuation was
to be looked for at a higher level. Mining upward
through the soft material, the coal had
been again struck at an elevation of 16 feet,
but not the full thickness of the seam, and
not in its true position; but after following it
upward 4 feet more the seam was found in its
natural state.</p>

<p>There seems to be no slate in this seam, but
occasionally there is found in it a ball of "nigger-head,"
or hard sulphurous matter, from the
size of a man's head down.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Another good bed.</span>Seam No. 1 is only partially exposed, the
workings having caved in; but enough of the
seam was visible to show that it was a bright,
soft, friable, bituminous coal, of good quality,
containing some slate and nigger-head. Its
fracture would be called <i>dicey</i> by some geologists,
because it breaks readily into small cubes,
even smaller than dice. The seam is probably
about five feet in thickness.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Geological relations.</span>This group probably corresponds geologically
with the Kirke Mines, on Green River; but,
judging by the eye, it is a more bituminous
coal and better suited to coking. The large
bed here may correspond with one of the large
beds at the Kirke Mines.</p>

<p>I fear that faults are numerous in the coal
rocks of this group, which, of course, would add
to the expense of mining. But if, as expected,
it furnishes a good smelting coke, the field will
be extremely valuable from its contiguity to the
magnetic ores of the Cascade Mountains and
the scarcity of coking coals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>This property was for sale when I visited it,
and would have been sold but for a claim of
ownership set up by the Northern Pacific Railroad,
which, however, in the opinion of good
lawyers, had no foundation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">This the bottom group.</span>This is the bottom group of the Washington
Territory coal field. It will be seen that, taking
the Gilman group, the Raging River group, and
the Snoqualmie group on one line, and the
Cedar River, Carbon River, and Green River
group on another line, it may be fairly claimed
that there are at least fifteen working seams of
three feet and upward in the Washington Territory
coal field.</p>

<p><i>e. The Yakima and Wenatchie Group.</i> This
field lies on the east flank of the Cascade Mountains,
on the waters of the Yakima and its tributaries,
Cle-ellum and Teanaway. It is believed
to extend also into the Wenatchie Valley, although
the area here is probably disconnected
from the Yakima area. I purposely refrained
from visiting this region, and for my statements
I am indebted chiefly to Bailey Willis, F. H.
Whitworth, Charles Burch, and Mr. Jamieson
of the Kirke Mines.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Yakima or Roslyn coal field.</span>The Yakima area lies north of the Yakima
River, near to the Northern Pacific Railroad,
and to the projected line of the Seattle, Lake
Shore and Eastern Railway, and extends about
sixty miles east and west, and six miles north and
south. Its dip is gentle, say twelve to twenty
degrees. It holds three coal seams of 2 feet
6 inches, and 5 feet and 5 feet respectively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
There is not much evidence of fracture in any
part of the field. The total thickness of the
coal-bearing rocks is estimated by Bailey Willis
to be 1,000 feet. This is evidently the lower
part of the coal series, the upper part having
been carried away. The best seam is mined
at Roslyn, four miles north of the Northern Pacific
Railroad, in the interest of that railroad.</p>

<p>The seam here furnishes upward of four feet
of good coal. The coal is bituminous, dull
black, firm, and free burning. Mr. Jamieson
thinks it will not make good coke. Others,
however, think that it will, and these are
supported partially by the laboratory test in
Washington City, D. C. (See Table of Coal
Analyses, <a href="#Page_107">page 107</a>.) It is called in the table
Roslyn coal.</p>

<p>This coal is used chiefly in the locomotives;
but the popular demand for it is very great in
the plateau country of East Washington.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Coal on the Wenatchie.</span>I have no knowledge of the coal on Wenatchie
River except what I obtained from Mr.
Burch, who says that there are two seams of
coal exposed in that valley, one of eight feet
and one of three feet. The coal-bearing rocks
extend for thirty-five miles up the river, and
have a width of ten miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Coal under the Great Bend
country.</span>The coal is reported by Mr. Burch to appear
east of the Columbia River, opposite to the
fields just described, and to disappear under the
basalt. If so, here is a resource for the future.
Concerning the importance of this coal field to
the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway,
I will speak in another connection.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The first mining on Bellingham
Bay.</span><i>f. Bellingham Bay, Skagit River, and other
Coal Fields.</i> The first shipping of coal from
Washington Territory was done from the Seahome
Mines, on Bellingham Bay, Puget Sound,
about twenty-five miles south of the Canada
line. The mines were very badly managed;
they took fire on several occasions. The coal
was of the lignitic grade, but not of the
best quality, and when other mines of better
coal were opened the Bellingham Bay mines
were closed. It is reported that coking coal
has been found some distance back from the
bay.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Coal on Skagit River.</span>Coal has also been found on Skagit River,
which, I suspect, from a sample which I saw
and from what I heard (some of it), is good,
and possibly might coke well. One of the
coal properties is held by A. Ford and others.
The following description is furnished by Mr.
Norman B. Kelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>It is found about three miles north of the
Skagit River, and about five miles from Sedro.
The country is hilly. There are at least six
or eight coal seams, perhaps more. Those examined
run from eighteen inches to thirty
inches, and are thought to be clean coal. The
seams lie between sandrocks. The outcrops
begin near the level of the valley, and continue
in a series to an altitude of 550 feet above the
valley. The highest outcrops are those of the
lowest seams geologically. The strike is north
sixty degrees west. At the foot of the hill, the
seams dip forty-five degrees to the southwest,
but the angle becomes steeper on the mountain
side, until finally they are vertical. All the
outcrops are within 1,500 feet horizontal distance.
Blacksmiths use the coal and pronounce
it equal to Cumberland. It cokes readily
in the open fire; burns with a bright, hot,
but small flame, and seems to leave but little
ash.</p>

<p>Of course, the thinness of these seams is an
objection. There is coal, also, upon the south
side of the river; but there has been but little
development in this field. An analysis of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
coal is given in the table preceding, but I
cannot say from what seam the sample was
derived.</p>

<p>The following analysis of coal of the Crystal
Mine, near Sterling, is said to have been made
by Mr. Wm. G. Tenne, assayer, of Portland,
Oregon:</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Coal south of Puget Sound.</span>It has long been known that there are considerable
areas of coal south and southwest of
Puget Sound. But they have not been very
highly esteemed, the coals being lignite of not
the best quality. There are at least two seams
of seven to twelve feet thickness, and they lie
at an angle of five degrees, with good roof and
floor. Some effort is now making on Skookumchuck
and Chehalis rivers to develop these
seams.</p>

<p>This coal is marketed chiefly in California.
The coal is lignitic; and yet it is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to coke well. It is also good stocking coal.
The beds dip from 5&#176; to 30&#176; southward. The
cost of transportation to San Francisco is about
the same as from Seattle, and the cost of delivering
on board ship about the same as from the
Newcastle mines. The tariff of 75 cents per
ton on foreign coal is regarded with satisfaction
by the coal men of Washington Territory. The
repeal of this tariff would inflict a heavy blow
upon the mining industry of the Territory.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Iron Ores.</span>II. <span class="smcap">Iron Ore.</span>&mdash;The iron ores of Washington
Territory consist of Bog ore, Brown ore
(Limonite), some Red, or Specular ore (Hematite),
and Magnetic ore (Magnetite). The bog
ore has been found in considerable quantities
underlying the flats bordering Puget Sound,
and has been worked in a furnace on Bellingham
Bay. These ores, no doubt, come from
the decomposition of the limonites, the magnetites
and the basaltic rocks of the high lands,
especially on the Cascade Mountains. These
Bellingham Bay ores generally have an excess
of phosphorus, and yield about 42 per cent. of
metallic iron. Brown ore is reported on the
Skagit River, sufficiently abundant, perhaps,
but not containing more than 40 per cent. metallic
iron. I saw a remarkable deposit of
brown ore on the Willamette, near Portland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Oregon. It is a horizontal stratum varying
from 4 to 20 feet in thickness, lying between
masses of basalt. It has been worked in the
Oswego furnace, but yielded only about 40 per
cent. metallic iron. I did not see any specular
ore in place in Washington Territory, but saw
samples, said to have been brought from near
the Middle Fork of Snoqualmie River.<span class="sidenote">The great magnetic ore beds of Cascade
Mountains.</span></p>

<p>But unquestionably the most important, as
well as the largest, are the magnetic ore beds on
the Cascade Mountains. These ores are found
1,000 to 1,500 feet above the chief water-courses
on those high ridges and peaks which
make up the Cascade Range along the headwaters
of the Snoqualmie, on the west side of
the mountain, and of the Yakima on the east
flank of the mountain. <span class="sidenote">Resembles the Cranberry
ore deposits.</span>These ores are underlaid
by syenite and quartzite, and overlaid by
limestone. The ore itself is found in conditions
similar to that of the Cranberry ore in the
Unaka Mountains of North Carolina; that is,
it lies in pockets of various sizes in hornblendic,
porphyritic and epidotic rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>I visited two exposures of this ore, one on
Mount Logan and the other on Mount Denny.
These are only a mile or two from the line of
the railroad. On Mount Logan there was
only one large outcrop of iron-bearing rocks,
<span class="sidenote">Guye Mine on Mount Logan.</span>but float was seen at numerous points on the
mountain. The main exposure showed an ore-bearing
rock, presenting a horizontal front some
sixty feet in length, and forty to fifty feet in
height or thickness. At one place a considerable
area in this space seemed to be pure ore. For
the rest, the pockets were smaller, and, of course,
the amount of rock proportionally larger.
What is to be found on going in from the surface
can never be told in advance in ore beds of
this sort. In working the great mine of Cranberry,
North Carolina, the largest body of ore
was reached 100 to 200 feet from the surface.</p>

<p>This bed of ore is known as The Summit, or
Guye Mine. Its elevation is 1,250 feet above
the grade of the Lake Shore Railroad, and
about 1,000 feet above the small stream at the
foot of the mountain. There would be no difficulty
in building an inclined plane from the ore
bank to the small valley below. The snow in
winter might interfere with mining.</p>

<p>Ascending the mountain above the main exposure,
I found what seemed to be another level
of iron ore 100 feet higher; but possibly it may
be the same bed displaced. Still higher appeared
to be a third level of ore, and higher still, I
observed a little float ore at a point nearly 2,000
feet above the grade of the railroad, on what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
may be called the summit of Mount Logan, at a
point which my barometer made 4,700 feet
above Puget Sound.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Denny Mine.</span>The Denny Mine is on a different mountain,
somewhat farther to the west, but about the
same distance from the railroad. It is reached
also by a narrow valley from which a steep
ascent of nearly 1,100 feet is made to the main
exposure, which shows an edge of pure fine-grained
magnetite, about twenty feet thick, with
limestone above, and also beneath, apparently.
Fragments of epidote, porphyry and flinty
quartzite lay around. The limestone did not
show so large here as on Mount Logan. The
ore dips steeply toward the south, and seemed
to encrust the mountain for a distance of, perhaps,
225 feet, but with a somewhat broken
surface. It then passed with its limestone under
quartzite cliffs which crest the mountain. The
bed might have been followed around the
mountain, where it is said to show at a number
of places. It seemed to pass into a matrix
of chert.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Chair Peak, or Kelly Mine.</span>I did not visit the Chair Peak, or Kelly Mine,
which is some miles distant; but I conversed
with probably every man who ever saw it,
some half a dozen, including Mr. Whitworth,
who made a survey of the property. It is
reported as probably the largest and purest of
all the deposits of magnetic ore, and lies at about
the same height on the mountains. This ore
would come out by way of the Middle Fork of
Snoqualmie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Middle Fork Mines.</span>I did not visit Guye's other mine, which lies
high, perhaps 3,000 feet above Middle Fork.
Mr. Guye represents it as similar in character to
the bed elsewhere, with the addition of some
brown and red ore. The other deposits mentioned
I received no description of.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">All easily reached from Seattle,
Lake Shore and Eastern Railway.</span>None of these mines have been developed
beyond the uncovering of a face. As yet there
is no furnace for smelting them, and no means
provided for bringing them off the mountains.
There is no difficulty about reaching them with
spur railroads and inclined planes. It has occurred
to me as possible that a narrow gauge
railroad might reach all of these mines, without
heavy grades, by starting at the highest point of
the Lake Shore road and following the divides
from mountain to mountain. This, however, can
only be determined by a special reconnaissance.</p>

<p>There are large deposits of iron ore also on
the east side of the Cascade Mountains, not
<span class="sidenote">Cle-ellum ore beds.</span>far from the crest line, on the waters of the
Cle-ellum River. Three distinct beds are reported.
They are all in the valley of the Cle-ellum
River.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span> The upper bed is situated about
eight miles above Cle-ellum Lake, on the main
and east fork of the Cle-ellum River. This bed
has been described to me by Mr. Whitworth and
Mr. Burch. The distance from the Northern
Pacific Railroad is twenty-five miles, following
the Cle-ellum valley. It is within sixteen miles
of the most distant location made of the Seattle,
Lake Shore and Eastern Railway; and by another
route which has been spoken of, this railroad
would pass close to the ore bed. Mr. Whitworth
says concerning it: "The ledge is well
defined, and is traced and located about two
miles, its course being nearly north and south.
It is apparently from forty to sixty feet in
width, and pitches at about an angle of 20&#176; to
the west. The casing rock is porphyry. The
deposit is evidently extensive. The ore appears
rich, is magnetic, and is reported to assay from
56&frac12; to 66 per cent. I obtained samples of
the rock, from which satisfactory tests can be,
no doubt, obtained."</p>

<p>The elevation of the iron ore outcrop is estimated
at 3,000 feet, which would place it nearly
on a level with the summit of Snoqualmie Pass;
but it is only about 200 feet above the local
water-level.</p>

<p>Mr. Burch says concerning this ore bed, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
has now been bought by Mr. Kirke for the Moss
Bay Company, that the strike of the bed is northeast,
whilst the outcrop runs northwest. The ore
is in five or more separate beds, each bed being
on an average forty to fifty feet thick, and the
beds separated by rock. The ore can be followed
but a short distance along the strike.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Burch's ore bed.</span>Burch's iron ore bed approaches the Cle-ellum
River about four miles below the Kirke
bed, and extends in a northeast direction to the
headwaters of Boulder Creek, a distance of five
miles. The outcrop crosses three high ridges.
The dip is south, at an angle of 45&#176;. The
width is at least twenty feet. A ferruginous
limestone lies against the ore on the south
side. The limestone is 300 or 400 feet thick.
It seems to overlie the iron bed. Its outside
or top layers are pure blue limestone.</p>

<p>A gray sandstone, rather soft, overlies the
limestone, and over this comes a coal-bearing
rock in which are dykes of gray iron ore, some
of them standing out of the ground 80 or
100 feet. The magnetic iron ore is associated
with hornblende and quartzite. All rocks dip
south. Mr. Burch says that this ore resembles
the Kirke ore, but has some of the characteristics
of hematite. Mr. Guye talks in the same
way about his iron ore on Middle Fork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>At one point, not far from Cle-ellum River,
a bed of gray iron ore crosses the magnetic ore
at right angles. This gray ore is not well understood.
It may be an altered copper lode.
The main ore bed is more strongly magnetic
near the intersection than it is elsewhere.</p>

<p>I may here remark that Mr. Burch reports
considerable float of rich magnetite on the
shores of Lake Chelan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Dudley ore bed.</span>I have no description of the Dudley iron ore
bed, but it is said to be large, and of the best
quality. Its location is also in the Cle-ellum
valley, between Burch's bed and the lake, and
within four or five miles of the lake. This information
I get through a letter written from Cle-ellum
to Mr. Whitworth. I have no personal
knowledge of these Cle-ellum beds.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Undoubtedly large beds of
steel ores.</span>There can be no doubt as to the existence in
the Cascade Mountains along this line of superior
iron ore in large quantities, the most of
which is suited to the manufacture of steel.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Of superior quality.</span>There can be no doubt as to the superior
quality of the Snoqualmie iron ores. Analysis
shows that they rank with the best steel ores in
their large percentage of metallic iron and small
admixture of deleterious impurities. Of the
following tables, the first gives all the reliable
analyses I could obtain of the ores of the Sno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>qualmie
region of the Cascade Mountains.
Those reported from Mr. Kirke and Mr. Dewey
are of high authority. Those from Mr. Jenner
are given in Governor Squire's report for 1885,
and are probably equally reliable.</p>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>This showing places the Snoqualmie ores in
the front rank of American steel ores; indeed,
it shows a little higher in metallic iron, and a
little lower in phosphorus, than any of the
others. These analyses are, of course, made
from the ore proper; <i>i.e.</i>, without any addition
of the matrix, or gangue-rock, in which the
ores are imbedded. With all magnetites of
this type it is only in exceptional spots that
much of the ore can be gotten, free from the
enclosing rock. Under ordinary circumstances
something like 20 per cent. of the ore sent
to the furnace will be gangue-rock. There is
reason to hope, however, that ere long there
will be a practical method for separating the
rock from the ore, and at the same time getting
rid of most of the sulphur. At Cranberry, N. C.,
the ore is now roasted and stamped into small
bits, and an experiment has been made of passing
the ore through a jigger, whereby the hornblendic
and other enclosing rocks were separated by
the pulsations of the water, as in coal washing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Improved processes.</span>The Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company,
Pennsylvania, has been separating the ore from
the rock with good results. The same has been
done at Crown Point, N. Y., Lion Mountain,
near Plattsburg, N. Y., Negaunee, Mich., and
Beach Glen, N. J.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>The process is really one of concentration, in
some respects similar to that pursued with the
refractory ores of the precious and base metals.
The ore is first calcined sufficiently to make it
friable. It is then crushed, by a Blake or other
rock-breaker, and is finally sluiced, or jigged, or
both. The aim is to produce a Bessemer concentrate
which would yield 60 per cent. or
more metallic iron, and at the same time get
rid of whatever phosphorus might be in the
gangue-rock. In the best experiments the object
was more than accomplished. The concentrate
contained 63 per cent. of metallic iron,
the middlings 55 per cent., and the tailings 16
per cent. This experiment was made with a
refractory Adirondack magnetite, which was
so intermixed with hornblende, quartz, mica,
etc., that the ore might be described as a hornblendic
gneiss, carrying a large proportion of
magnetite. No doubt experience will teach
some way of saving the ore that is now wasted
in the tailings.</p>

<p>Thus we may hope to see removed in a short
time the only practical difficulty in working the
crystalline magnetites, such as those of Snoqualmie,
and many others.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Granite.</span>III. <span class="smcap">Granite, Limestone and Marble.</span>&mdash;What
is here called granite is really syenite. It
is found high on the mountains, associated, as
already intimated, with the magnetic iron ore,
and with hard quartzite, porphyry, epidote,
hornblende, and limestone largely marbleized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
This group of rocks forms the core of the Cascade
Mountains, and hence underlies all the
coal-bearing rocks to the westward. The group
has been assigned by some geologists to the
Archæan age; but it is possible that they are
metamorphosed strata of the Silurian, or some
subsequent period. Some of this syenite has a
large proportion of quartz, which gives it a
light appearance; but in other places the hornblende
crystals are of good size and in full proportion,
and the feldspar is of the orthoclase
variety, which gives a mixture of three colors,
and makes fully as handsome a stone as the
Quincy granite.</p>

<p>Limestone is reported as existing in some of
the islands in Puget Sound, where it is burnt
into lime; but I have met with no particular
account of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Marble and limestone.</span>The limestone and marble associated with the
iron ore on the Cascade Mountains has already
been alluded to. It is of fine quality, very
abundant, and easily quarried. It will have
great value for flux and commercial lime. It
is also beautiful in color, varying from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
purest white to blue, and mixtures of the two
colors. In texture it is sometimes exceedingly
fine grained, and in others crystallized into a
true and beautiful marble, which, so far as can
be judged by eye, would be well adapted to
both inside and outside finishing and statuary.
On Mount Logan the limestone deposit almost
covers the mountain above the lower line of
the iron ore, and is so exposed as to be quarried
with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>The same association of limestone in heavy
beds with iron ore seems to exist also on the
Cle-ellum, as mentioned by Mr. Burch. This
gentleman spoke to me, also, of a very beautiful
and easily burned limestone in the Wenatchie
Valley. Large beds of limestone also
exist in connection with the precious and base
metals, which are next to be described. In the
Colville country limestone seems to abound.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Precious metals on Cascade
Mountains.</span>IV. <span class="smcap">The Precious and Base Metals.</span>&mdash;In
the Cascade Mountains, and in the mountains
north of the plateau country of East Washington,
and in the C&#339;ur d'Alene Mountains, within
the border of Idaho, occur numerous veins bearing
gold, silver, copper, lead, sulphur and iron.
Discoveries on Cascade Mountain proper have
been made on both sides, chiefly in the region
of the iron ore. Those at the Denny and Chair
Peak mines have been most spoken of. Professor
Mason, of the "Rennselaer Polytechnic
Institute," Troy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> New York, gives the following
assay of two samples sent from the Chair Peak

<p><span class="sidenote">On Cle-ellum River.</span>Metallic veins are found also in connection
with iron ore on Cle-ellum River. Mr. Burch
reports a copper and silver lode, and also two
lodes of gold and silver, in this neighborhood.
He reports the ores as high grade, of good,
workable thickness, and outcropping for several
thousand feet. There is a gray ore in the same
region, the character of which has not yet been
determined. This has already been mentioned
as lying close to the iron ore, and may possibly
be metamorphosed chalcopyrite. Mr. Burch
thinks that the silver ores will run from forty
to eighty ounces, while in some spots the richness
is very extraordinary. The lead ore in association
ranges from fifteen to forty per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Large copper vein in Stevens
County.</span>The same gentleman, who is a resident of the
Okinagane region, reports a remarkable lode of
copper ore running due south across Stevens
County, from the Canada line to the Columbia
River. It shows a plain outcrop for about
forty miles. The vein carries both native and
gray copper and a small percentage of silver.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Precious metals on Methow
River.</span>Reports, apparently authentic, are made of
numerous other veins of metal in the same
region, particularly in the valley of the Methow
River and the valley of the Okinagane River.
The Colville region, beginning fifty miles north
of Spokane Falls, is well known as a rich mining
centre.</p>

<p>What I know of these regions I learned from
the oral or written testimony of men who had
seen what they described, and some of them
residents of the localities.</p>

<p>The basin of the Methow River has been
but little prospected, and although I gathered
many favorable items concerning the mineral
deposits there, I met but one man who had
personally examined the country, and he confirmed
the favorable reports. He said the ores
were similar to those on the Okinagane, but
were more abundant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span><span class="sidenote">The rich mines of Okinagane.</span>The Okinagane country is well known, hundreds
of men having been at work there last
summer, and some of its mines, particularly
the Ruby and Arlington, having become notable
for their richness. Among my informants
are Mr. Burch and Mr. Thomas Lothian, who
both reside on the Okinagane River; and also
Mr. J. E. Clayton, mining engineer, who made
a professional report on the country, which was
printed in the Spokane Falls <i>Review</i>.</p>

<p>The mining district is on Conconnully Creek
(misnamed Salmon River), which enters Okinagane
River from the northwest, about twenty
miles from its mouth. There are two wagon roads
to the Conconnully, one from Spokane Falls,
with a branch from Sprague, distance 150 miles,
on which stages ran last summer. Another
road starts from Ellensburg on the Yakima,
and is 195 miles long. With an expenditure
of a few thousand dollars on the channel of
the Okinagane, the mouth of the Conconnully
could be reached from the Columbia by light-draught
steamers, from which a railway fifteen
miles long would reach the mines. Mr. Burch
says that he and his father sounded the river,
and also the Columbia, and that steamers can
start at Rock Island Rapids and go to the
mouth of the Conconnully, and, in flush water,
can ascend the creek. Mr. Clayton makes the
same statement as to the river. The country<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>
rocks in the mining districts are of the same
character as those associated with the iron ore
on Mount Logan and the Denny Mountain&mdash;hard
metamorphic and plutonic rocks.</p>

<p>The principal mineral lode is described by
Mr. Clayton as "composed of true quartz
gangue carrying the silver ore in disseminated
grains of black sulphurets of silver, with some
copper-silver glance, and a brittle sulphuret, resembling
tennantite, giving a dark, red, powdery
streak, approaching the characteristics of dark
antimonial ruby silver. In addition to this is
found galena and zinc-blende."</p>

<p>Assays made by Mr. Wm. H. Fuller, of
Spokane Falls, gave for first-class ore from this
lode: Silver, $186.45, and gold, $4.50 = $190.95
value per ton. Second-class ore assayed $34.16
silver and 45 cents gold. Mr. Slater thinks
that one-third of the vein will yield first-class
ore. It is a rich vein, averaging eight feet so
far as opened. There are two or three lodes in
the district. Years will be required to ascertain
their limits. But all the indications point
to large mining operations in the Okinagane
country as soon as the transportation can be
supplied.</p>

<p>My chief authority for the following statements
concerning the Colville region is Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Kearney, one of the firm of Kearney Brothers,
owners of the two largest mines of that country,
namely, the Old Dominion and the Daisy. I
incorporate some statements also from two
articles published in the Spokane Falls <i>Review</i>,
one by W. E. Sullivan, and the other by J. B.
Slater.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The mines in the Colville
region.</span>The Colville region is the east end of Stevens
County, the part lying east of the Columbia
River and north of Spokane Falls. Its chief
town (500 inhabitants) is called Colville, from
the fort of that name which was situated there.
It is ninety-one miles north of Spokane Falls.
Between the two points there is almost a continuous
valley of great productiveness. The
mineral region begins at Chewelah, fifty miles
north of Spokane Falls, and continues at least
forty miles north of Colville. Granite, porphyry,
and limestone are found here, as in the other
metalliferous regions. In some cases the ores
are in slate and quartz; in others, in granite and
porphyry; in still others, limestone. Some of
the ores are iron carbonates, carrying silver,
gold, and lead in paying quantities. In other
cases, as at the Old Dominion mines, the ore
exists in the form of a chloride and black sulphate
in limestone walls.</p>

<p>Rich mines of argentiferous galena were dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>covered
last summer three or four miles east of
Chewelah, and vigorously developed at numerous
points. Seven miles west of Chewelah
shafts were sunk on a rich vein, three feet wide,
of gray copper and silver chloride. The Eagle
Mine was the first discovery, and is the most
noted. It is black metal, containing galena,
silver, and gold. Altogether, there are said to
be two hundred mining claims, more or less
developed, in the district around Chewelah.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Old Dominion Mine.</span>The mines in the Colville district are very
numerous. The Old Dominion Mine is six
miles east of the town. It is on an 8-foot
fissure vein, which assays 150 ounces silver, 25
per cent. galena, and $7.00 gold to the ton of
ore. There are ten mines in the Old Dominion
group; and Mr. Slater states that the $80,000
worth of silver reported as the product of
Washington Territory in 1886, all went from
the Old Dominion group.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Daisy Mine.</span>The Daisy Mine is twenty-four miles southward
from Colville. The vein here is 25 feet
wide, with a streak of ore in it 18 inches wide,
which widens to 11 feet 8 inches at the bottom
of the shaft. This shaft is 127 feet deep.
Seventy-five feet from the top of the shaft, a
tunnel has been run off horizontally in five feet
of ore. The assay reported for the Daisy ore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
gives silver 50 ounces, gold $2.00, lead 30 per
cent., and iron 25 per cent. It is self-fluxing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Young America Company.</span>Sixteen miles and a half northward from
Colville, near the Columbia River, a rich discovery
of silver-lead ore has been made by the
Young America Consolidated Company. The
vein averages five feet, runs northeast and
southwest, and has been shafted through ore
to the depth of 180 feet. A test showed 90
ounces of silver and 40 per cent. of lead. A
number of other openings have been made on
the lode.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Little Dalles.</span>The Little Dalles, thirty-eight miles north of
Colville, is another neighborhood rich in mineral.
The ores are galena and lead carbonate,
with silver. On Bruce Creek, and east of
Bruce Creek, twelve miles north of Colville,
are similar veins. A smelter of twenty tons
capacity has been erected at Colville, which
affords encouragement to mining; but it is not
satisfactory to the largest owners. Smelting
should be done on a large scale, and in a centre
of large business. There can be no doubt that
here, also, will be a region of great activity and
large production as soon as it is connected by
rail with Spokane Falls.</p>

<p>I have indicated the mining localities on the
map accompanying this Report as nearly as my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
information would allow, but only an approximation
is expected.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">C&#339;ur d'Alene Mines.</span>The region that just now is attracting most
attention is the C&#339;ur d'Alene country, because
the mines are more developed; and they are
more developed because the miners have better
transportation than exists in the Colville and
the other mineral regions. Some thousands of
men were at work last season on the streams
entering the lake, particularly on the South
Fork of the C&#339;ur d'Alene River.</p>

<p>At Spokane Falls I was able to get reliable
information concerning the region, and would
mention as chief among my authorities Mr. S. S.
Glidden, at one time well known in Alabama as
an able iron manufacturer, now proprietor of the
Tiger Mine, on Canyon Creek, which empties
into one branch of C&#339;ur d'Alene River. By
reference to the map, the following description
may be readily understood:</p>

<p>The C&#339;ur d'Alene Mountains, River and
Lake are in Idaho Territory, near the line of
Washington Territory. The drainage is through
Spokane River into the Columbia. The distance
from the nearest point on the lake to
Spokane Falls is twenty-five miles. The C&#339;ur
d'Alene River has two branches, on both of
which mining has been done, but most largely<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>
on the South Fork. Previous to 1886, all the
mining on this fork was done at Eagle, Beaver,
Delta, Murray, etc., and was chiefly gold placer
mining, which was not particularly remunerative.
Placer mining has also been done on the South
Fork; but the chief ores on this branch are
argentiferous galena, with some gold in quartz.
A large number of claims have been worked
into since the beginning in 1885, and the increase
of mining population has been going on
rapidly. Mr. Glidden thought that there were
ten thousand people last fall in the C&#339;ur
d'Alene mining country. The veins are accessible
and very thick, some of them as much as
forty feet. The ores usually carry 40 to 60 per
cent. of lead, 5 to 50 ounces of silver, and often
about $3.00 in gold to the ton of ore. The
veins are true fissures, and strike across the
country rocks, which are principally porphyry
and quartzite. The strike of the main veins
runs parallel to the river, and at a distance of
two to six miles from it. There are many cross
gulches which cut the veins at right angles, and
thus present vertical faces which offer the best
facilities for prospecting and for mining.</p>

<p>The veins have been opened at so many
places as to put beyond doubt their continuity
on long lines, and their great abundance. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
fact, the indications point to a development
resembling that made near Leadville.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The large tonnage from and
to the mines.</span>Some of the ore must be concentrated, and
much of it must be shipped in bulk to the reduction
works. Such tonnage is considered the
best possible for a railroad. The ore can be
carried in any kind of car, and is not subject
to theft or any sort of damage; and yet its
precious character enables it to bear higher
freight rates than pig-iron. There are no fluxes
in the country outside of the ore itself, and it
will be more economical to carry the ore out
than to bring in fluxes. The smelting of the
ores on the ground would be further embarrassed
by the difficulty in getting fuel. The
timber is in patches, and often inaccessible;
hence charcoal would be costly, and there is no
coke to be gotten anywhere near. The smelting
of mixed ores of this sort is a very complicated
process, requiring quite a number of different
elements, and can be most economically
conducted on a large scale, and by the mixture
of various different ores. Hence the advantage
of having these works at some great centre
where ores of many kinds may be brought. In
the establishment of such a centre, of course,
reference should be had to commercial and
trading facilities. A large mining community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
in one place and a large commercial and manufacturing
community in another, involves large
transportation of crude materials, and of manufactured
products, of food, and of passengers.</p>

<p>As yet, the C&#339;ur d'Alene mining is in its
early infancy. Means of transportation are
partially furnished by means of water and short
narrow-gauge railroads, but they are insufficient.
Shipments now are small, but they will rapidly
increase, and Mr. Glidden thinks that in three
years 2,000 tons of ore will come out <i>daily</i>,
and as many tons of freight go in&mdash;certainly a
splendid outlook for business.</p>

<p>In <i>concluding</i>, as I have now done, the general
statement in regard to the physical resources
of Washington Territory, I would remark, that
all the facts stated heretofore have a close relation
to the interests of the Seattle, Lake Shore
and Eastern Railway and its friends, and that
the remainder of this report will consist in practical
applications of the facts to the railroad and
personal interests involved.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">SPECIAL REMARKS on the Country
and its Resources along the Line of
the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern
Railway.</span></h2>

<h3>SEATTLE.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Commercial and manufacturing
advantages.</span>Concerning this city of 15,000 to 16,000 inhabitants,
I need not repeat what has been so
well said in the reports of Governor Squire, and
of United States officers who have examined
and reported to the Government with regard to
this location&mdash;notably, Gen. Isaac I. Stephens,
Gen. George B. McClellan, Gen. Nelson A.
Miles, and others; also by the Seattle Chamber
of Commerce. Its location, its harbor,
its people, its commerce and manufactures, its
solid and rapid growth, and its local relation to
all the great natural resources of the Territory,
give to Seattle advantages which cannot be
equaled by any other port on the Sound. Its
climate, as to temperature, both in winter and
summer, is remarkable.<span class="sidenote">Good climate.</span> It is pleasantly cool in
summer, and in winter rarely severe. Its only
drawback is an excess of moisture for perhaps
four months of the winter season. But this is
preferable to the violent storms and deep snows
and extreme cold to which the Eastern plains
and the upper Mississippi country are subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and which sometimes attack New York and the
New England States. On Puget Sound there
are no blizzards nor cyclones, and rarely so
much as an inch of snow. The medical testimonies
give a very favorable hill of health.</p>

<p>The industries of city and country are prosecuted
with less interruption from weather than
in any of the States east of the Rocky Mountains.
The annual rainfall is not greater, not
so great, indeed, as in some parts of the Atlantic
seaboard. It is not so well distributed among
the months as it is eastward; but outdoor work
rarely stops on Puget Sound.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Good population.</span>The population of Seattle struck me as exceedingly
good. Her controlling classes are
men of character, intelligence and substance.
The appearance of the stores, the streets, the
offices, and factories, would do credit to an old
city. Water, electric lights, street railways,
good fire companies, well organized police,
handsome residences, churches, schools&mdash;all
attest the progress of her civilization. <span class="sidenote">High civilization.</span>Her
wharves and railroad depots are crowded with
business. The special pride of the city seems
to be her schools, public and private. Her
large and handsome school buildings seem purposely
to have been placed in the most prominent
positions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Her public school system is
well organized and supported. The University
of the Territory is located here, and in full
operation. These things, considered together,
augur most favorably for the future of this
young city.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Railroad lines.</span>Her growth will be rapidly accelerated by the
extension of her railroads. Besides her coal
roads, she will soon be practically the connecting
point of certainly two, and perhaps three, transcontinental
railroad lines. She now has railroad
connection with the Northern Pacific, and will
shortly be connected with the Canadian Pacific
by the West Coast road. But the road that will
do most for Seattle, indeed, the road which of
itself would make a city at its Sound terminus,
is the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad.
This will be true if the road never crosses
the limits of Washington Territory; but no
doubt it will ultimately cross the continent, or
at least have close transcontinental connections.</p>

<p>When these roads are thus extended, they
will bring vast quantities of lumber, and of
mineral and agricultural products, and carry in
exchange foreign and domestic products for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the supply of the rural and mining population,
to say nothing of the great Eastern trade. Her
coastwise and foreign trade have already been
discussed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The chief ship-building
centre.</span>Puget Sound must also become the chief
ship-building centre of the continent, and the
possession by Seattle of the great fresh-water
lakes so close to the Sound, and the fact that
here will be the point where the Bessemer pig-iron
and its products will be manufactured, will
give this point advantage over all others on the
Sound. Seattle will build ships for England,
New England, South America, Asia, and the
Islands of the Ocean; and just here will first be
seen the dawning of the new day which will
come to our American merchant marine, of late
so depressed. And the Government itself must
sooner or later establish on Lake Washington
a navy-yard where ships can be built of the best
material at minimum cost; and where her ships
out of commission can lie landlocked, secure
from the teredo and the corroding effects of
sea-water, and can at once get rid of their
barnacles.<span class="sidenote">Seattle better located than San
Francisco.</span></p>

<p>Seattle can have no rival on the Pacific Coast
except San Francisco, which has the only good
harbor and entrance outside of Puget Sound,
but which has no coal, nor iron, nor timber,
and whose back-country does not equal the
Snoqualmie valley of East Washington for
agricultural and mineral capabilities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE TERMINAL PROPERTY OF THE SEATTLE, LAKE
SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Unrivalled terminal property.</span>The city and suburban property which the
railroad has secured is singularly valuable, and
will afford every facility for city and foreign
business. It is correctly described in the documents
of the company. No future road can
acquire such facilities. They approach a monopoly
of great value.</p>

<h3>SUBURBAN INTERESTS.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">But two entrances by land.</span>There can be practically but two railroad entrances
to Seattle, one from the south, and the
other from the north, owing to the bluff ground
on which the city is built, with Puget Sound in
front and Lake Washington in the rear. The
roads from the existing coal mines and from
the Northern Pacific enter from the south; the
Lake Shore road enters from the north. Suburban
improvements will no doubt be extended
both north and south. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>But it seemed to me
that for residences and amusements the northern
end has the advantage,<span class="sidenote">Superiority of the northern
suburbs.</span> as the high lands
are more convenient to the railroad, and command
fine views of those beautiful lakes on the
east, and of the Sound on the west. Here will
be the pleasant drives, the place for sailing,
rowing and swimming; for open-air games,
picnics, etc. On the east side of Lake Washington
will be vegetable and fruit gardens and
dairies, whose products will reach the city by this
railroad; to all of which have been added the
powerful influence of the Moss Bay operations.</p>

<p>The logging business begins in sight of the
city, and a number of logging camps were
already in operation along the first twenty miles
of the railroad. After the loggers, follow the
farmers. Already a surprising number of people
have established homes in this direction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Factories of the future.</span>Near the Sound and a little distance from
the city will be great saw-mills, grain elevators,
canneries, and, in time, fish-oil and fertilizer
mills, tanneries, smelting furnaces, sulphuric
acid and other chemical works. And here will
be the ship canal<span class="sidenote">Ship canal.</span> connecting the lakes with the
Sound, and the shipyards of the future.</p>

<span class="caption">A TRAIN-LOAD OF LOGS ON THE SEATTLE, LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILWAY.</span>
</div>

<h3>TIMBER.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>The great lumber interest will have a larger
and richer field on the Seattle, Lake Shore and
Eastern Railroad than on any other through
line in Washington Territory.<span class="sidenote">Superiority of the timber on the
Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway.</span> On the line of
the Northern Pacific Railroad the timber is
abundant, but too small for the mill, except in
a very few spots. The other roads show but
little left close by, and the trees never had the
size of those of Snoqualmie Valley. The West
Coast road, which will be tributary to the Lake
Shore Railroad, will pass through good forests;
but, according to my information, the forests on
the line of the Lake Shore road are the very
best in Washington Territory.</p>

<p>The forest of mill timber beginning in sight
of Seattle, continues with some intermissions to
the top of the Cascade Mountains. It increases
in size and quantity to a point far up on the
mountain side, and the trees continue of good
size all the way to the top. Crossing the Cascade
Mountains, on the east side the trees are
quite numerous, but smaller than on the west
side, though some of them can be sawed.
Continuing eastward, the trees get fewer and
smaller, and change from fir to ordinary yellow
and bull pine. In the plateau country of the
Great Bend there are only scattered groups of
stunted trees to be seen, and, excepting a few
skirts along the bluffs of the Columbia, no
forests of mill timber are to be met with until
after passing the Idaho line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span><span class="sidenote">The forests described.</span>I will now review this timber belt with more
particularity. After leaving Seattle, there is
a somewhat elevated country between the lakes
and Puget Sound, which is largely covered with
mill timber of medium size. Perhaps two feet
and a half would be about the average diameter
of the logs. Here, as everywhere, the principal
timber, and that most cut and valued, are the
Douglas fir and the white cedar.</p>

<p>Continuing along Lake Samamish, and up
Squak Creek, these forests continue on both
sides at some distance off. A large body of
moderately sized timber runs off toward the
northeast, covering the hills which lie in front
of the mountain range. Passing the Gilman
mines, we meet but little large timber until we
enter<span class="sidenote">Forests of Raging River.</span> the valley of Raging River. Here there
is an almost unbroken forest of splendid timber,
extending from near the mouth as far up
as I went, namely, ten miles from the mouth.
The mill timber here would average from six to
ten inches more in diameter than that we passed
near Lake Washington; and there seemed to
be a vast body of it in this valley. As far up
on the hill or mountain side as I went, or could
see, the trees retain their large size.</p>

<p>At the upper coal mines I found this to be
the case to the mountain top, 800 or 900 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
above the river. The trees were not only large,
and thick on the ground, but extremely tall and
free from knots. I was told that the heavy
forest continued a considerable distance above
the upper coal mines.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Forests near Hop Ranch.</span>In the Snoqualmie Valley proper are to be
found the largest forests and the largest trees.
The farmers and hop-growers have destroyed
thousands of acres of the finest timber trees on
the continent, but many, many thousand acres
still remain unbroken. Between Falls City and
Hop Ranch the wagon road passed through
two or three miles of this magnificent timber.
Turning from the road, I ascended the Snoqualmie
Mountain, and all the way up to the
coal openings I traveled in the densest forest
of the largest trees I had ever seen. Passing
the cleared country about Hop Ranch, I again
plunged into one of these monstrous forests,
and traveled three or four miles through it
without a break. The sun never touches the
earth in these forests. The trees rise to the
height of 250 feet or upward, and lock their
branches together far overhead, shutting out the
sunlight and awing the traveler. Their trunks
seem to stand absolutely straight and plumb
from the ground to the top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> I had studied the
long-leafed pine forests of Georgia, Alabama,
and Mississippi.<span class="sidenote">Superior to the Long Leaf forests of the
Southern States and of the Mississippi Bottom.</span> I had traveled for a hundred
miles through that marvelous forest on the
Yazoo Delta, where it seemed to me that Nature
had done her utmost in covering the
ground with vast and lofty trees; but here in
the Snoqualmie valley I traveled through forests
that for the size, height, and number of trees
to the acre, as much exceeded the forests of the
Yazoo bottom as the latter exceeded all other
forests I had ever seen. The Snoqualmie forest
also exceeds all others I have known in the
immense quantity of its fallen timber, which
renders locomotion off of the trails extremely
slow and difficult. The railroad ascends the
South Fork of the Snoqualmie. I did not go
up the Middle Fork, but was told that the
timber is fine in that valley also.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Trees ten feet in diameter.</span>The little Salal Prairie, five or six miles long,
and six miles from Hop Ranch, breaks the continuity
of the forests, but with that exception, it
continues to the pass of the mountain. As to
the size of the trees, I feel sure that I saw hundreds
that would average ten feet in diameter.
I measured two that were by no means singular,
and one gave a circumference of thirty-three
feet (equal to eleven feet diameter), and the
other not much less.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> There is no doubt that
many of these trees are 300 feet in height. I
think it likely that the<span class="sidenote">Average nearly five feet in diameter and 250
feet high.</span> average height of the
mill timber on the line of the road from Raging
River, for two-thirds of the way up the main
mountain (a distance of over twenty-five miles),
is 250 feet, and 150 feet of this clear of limbs,
and hence of knots. And I think that the
average diameter of the butt-cuts of the mill
timber would be near five feet. I found my
greatest difficulty in estimating by the eye the
average number of trees to an acre. I can only
say that I not only never saw so many, but I
never conceived it possible for such a number
of large trees to be supported by the soil of an
acre of ground. It was not unusual to see
many trees of six to eight feet in diameter
standing within ten feet of each other. I knew,
of course, that there were single trees in California,
and elsewhere, larger than any single
specimens to be found here, but I did not know
before going to Washington Territory that such
forests as these were to be found on the face of
the earth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lumber product per acre.</span>I shall leave to men better versed in the details
of the lumber business than I to estimate
the quantity of sawed lumber which would be
yielded by an acre of such timber, and by the
many thousands of acres which lie on, or near,
the line of this railroad. Somebody published
that the average yield of the Washington Territory
forests would be 30,000 feet to the acre,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>
and this may be, because there is much small
and scattered timber; but if this amount be
multiplied by six, it would not do justice to the
forests I saw in the Snoqualmie valley. There
are single trees that would make 30,000 feet of
lumber. It is fortunate that the fir and cedar
timber are preferred by the lumbermen, as
these varieties constitute the larger portion of
the forest. Undoubtedly the hemlock will all
be wanted at an early day, and so of the larch
and the less abundant trees, both evergreen and
deciduous.</p>

<p>The bearing of these facts on the interests of
the railroad are obvious. Such bodies of timber,
standing close to the road for a distance of
eighty miles, would of itself guarantee the success
of the road for a generation to come.</p>

<p>And there is everything favorable in the
position of the timber with reference to the
track, especially if the track, in ascending the
mountain, can be kept near the river. It is to
be hoped that the timber along the right of way
will be saved for sawing. It would be no small
item in paying for the road.</p>

<p>There will promptly spring up along the
whole line both logging-camps and saw-mills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Besides those already in operation, I heard of
some large new enterprises projected. The demand
for lumber is so insatiable, and the profits
of the business so good, that an extensive fresh
field like this will be entered with avidity by an
army of lumbermen.</p>

<h3>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Agricultural freights.</span>The agricultural interest is not so large at
present on the west side of the Cascade Range,
as the timber, coal and iron interests, but it is
growing, and will become exceedingly important.
East of the Cascade Mountains this will be the
chief railroad interest in the beginning, though
ultimately it will be surpassed by the tonnage
of the mines. I have heretofore described the
soils and vegetable products of West Washington,
but would say specially with regard to
the belt we are considering, that it is destined
to be a fine agricultural region. The bottom
lands of Squak Creek, and of Snoqualmie
River, including all its branches and tributaries,
are extremely fertile, and suited to produce
the largest crops of grass, oats, barley, hops, and
roots of almost every sort, besides most of the
overground vegetables.</p>

<span class="caption">HAY-MAKING IN WASHINGTON TERRITORY
ALONG LINE OF SEATTLE, LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILWAY.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Produce of Hop Ranch.</span>At my request, Mr. Wilson, the manager,
and one of the owners of the Hop Ranch, furnished
me the following written statement concerning
that estate, which, although larger than
any other on the route, is not richer than many
other places of smaller size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<h3>MR. WILSON'S LETTER.</h3>

<blockquote><p class="quotdate">
<span class="smcap">Snoqualmie, W. T.</span>, Nov. 3, 1887.<br /></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Ruffner.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>: In response to your request, I
make the following memoranda. Our Hop
Farm consists of 1,500 acres of rich alluvial
soil; 300 acres in hops, which produce from
1,800 to 2,000 pounds per acre. We also raise
150 acres of oats, producing sixty to seventy-five
bushels per acre. From 100 to 150 acres
in hay, producing about three tons to the acre.
Also large quantities of vegetables, such as
potatoes, carrots, turnips and onions. All kinds
of root vegetables are prolific except sweet potatoes.
Fruits, such as apples, pears, prunes,
plums, and berries of all kinds, are in abundance.
Last year we had over 5,000 bushels of
apples.</p>

<p>At present we ship in about 500 tons per
year of merchandise and supplies, and ship out,
in the way of hops and other things, from 400
to 500 tons per year. This we could double if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>we had railroad facilities for shipping. We employ
during the winter&mdash;that is, in November,
December and January&mdash;about forty men; the
rest of the year, from 75 to 1,200 men and
women. The keeping up of this supply of
labor, which all comes from Seattle, would be
quite an item to the traffic of a railroad. I presume
you know that where there are a large
number of people employed, they are continually
coming and going. In speaking with a
railroad contractor the other day, he told me
that in order to keep 500 men at work, he had
to keep 1,500 on the road. This will also be
an important item when the mines are working
above here. There are a great many items
of interest to which I might call your attention,
but I will confine myself to the above at
present.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Yours, very respectfully,<br />

T. G. WILSON,<br />
SECRETARY AND MANAGER OF THE
HOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sidenote">Farming, fruit and grazing
lands.</span>Besides the bottom lands, there are large
areas of what might be called table-lands, north
and northeast of the lakes, which are top-dressed
with glacial drift, but which will be well
adapted to the crops of the country, and especially
to fruits. And besides the table-lands, the
smaller mountains are generally adapted to agriculture,
and especially to grazing. My impression,
as heretofore stated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> is that, ultimately, West
Washington will become a great grazing region,
though it is generally supposed that East Washington
is to be the chief cattle country. But
the mild and equable climate, and the abundance
of rain, ensures abundant forage summer
and winter in West Washington. This will be
important for the feeding of cities farther south,
as well as for sending canned and refrigerator
beef far and wide over the Pacific Ocean. The
growth of vegetables, especially of root crops,
is something phenomenal on both sides of the
Cascade Mountains, and will furnish a large
item of commerce, as is shown already by the
large shipments of potatoes from Seattle, and
the multiplication of canneries.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Hops, barley and beer.</span>The hop interest is a large one, but the low
prices of the last year or two have checked the
progress of this industry. Breweries have
already been established at Seattle, and elsewhere
on Puget Sound, and, as the chief materials
for beer (barley and hops) are produced
here so cheaply and abundantly, we may expect
Puget Sound beer to become quite a large item
of commerce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The Snoqualmie and Squak valleys have as
yet but a scattered agricultural population, but
ultimately farms will be opened along all the
streams, and even high up on the Cascade
Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The two great railroads.</span>On the east side of the Cascade Mountains
the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway
will closely parallel the Northern Pacific Railroad
for a short distance in the Yakima River
valley, but will probably leave it soon after
entering the most productive part. The route,
however, may be varied to suit circumstances,
and as to this point no doubt would be if the
talk of making Ellensburg the State capital
should become serious. The remark may here
be thrown in that this meeting of the two railroads
in the Yakima valley will be no disadvantage
to the Seattle road, as the distance to Puget
Sound is about the same, and the incidental
advantages are in favor of Seattle.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Great Bend country.</span>Crossing the Columbia River, the railway
will enter the great plateau which has been so
fully described, and if the passage should be
made at Rock Island Rapids, it will cross the
plateau at its widest part. Nothing more need
be said as to the great agricultural capabilities
of the plateau country. The Great Bend, or
northern limb of the plateau, is more extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
than the southern division, but it is a much less
settled country, owing partly to want of transportation,
and partly to want of water. This
scarcity of water in Douglas County<span class="sidenote">Douglas County.</span> was formerly
thought to be incurable without a resort to
artesian wells; but experiment has shown that
wells of good water can be obtained at moderate
depths, as I was informed by Mr. Smith, a
resident of the county, and by Mr. Nash, the
lawyer, who owns property there. The population
and, consequently, the business of this large
county is limited at present, but it has a large
body of good land in it, which will attract settlers
before long. Its soil is of the same character as
that of other parts of the plateau; but the general
impression seemed to be that it was not quite
equal to the land of the Snake River Basin, or
to the adjoining county of Lincoln, owing in
part to a larger proportion of rough land. I do
not, however, consider this question by any
means as settled. The best area for wheat is
supposed to be that which borders on Lincoln
County. If the route for the Seattle railway
which is preferred by Mr. Mohr, should be
adopted, it would pass across the northern part
of the county, by many persons considered the
best part, and leave the great body of the
county out of reach to the southward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Lincoln County.</span>Lincoln County, through the length of which
the road must pass, is universally admitted to
be among the best agricultural counties on the
plateau. It is also settling up rapidly, and has
become a large producer of wheat, even at the
disadvantage of a long haul in wagons. Mr.
Curtis, who buys much of the Lincoln County
wheat for his mill at Spokane Falls, says that
the average yield of wheat is twenty-five
bushels per acre, though in 1886 (the year of
failure) it fell to sixteen and one-half bushels.
Captain McGowan, of Lincoln County, also
gave twenty-five bushels as the average crop,
and said this would hold good for the whole
period since the settlement of the county, including
the bad year 1886.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Spokane County.</span>By reference of the official map showing the
wheat areas, it will be seen that the Seattle
railway passes through the middle of these areas
in both Lincoln and Spokane counties. The
testimony was entirely favorable in regard to
horticultural and pomological products, as well
as to the agricultural, in the strict sense. The
population of the three counties, Douglas,
Lincoln and Spokane, was put by Governor
Semple at nearly 18,000; about 17,000 of which
was in Lincoln and Spokane.<span class="sidenote">Price of farming lands.</span> Much land has
been bought with a view to settlement as well
as speculation, and this would be occupied and
cultivated <i>pari passu</i> with the progress of the
railroad, and there yet remains much good land
which can be bought at low prices, say from
one dollar to five dollars an acre, and will attract
settlers. Farming lands here will have
market at the mines north of the Columbia
River, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>at Spokane Falls, where there will be a
large city, as well as large mills, and at Seattle,
where there will be a large demand not only
for the city, but for shipping.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Tonnage.</span>No reliable estimates can now be made as
to what business this Great Bend country will
furnish ten to twenty years hence. We have
only this to guide us, namely, that the part of
the plateau which lies south of the Northern
Pacific Railroad now furnishes 400,000 tons
of wheat for transportation annually, besides
other freight and passengers; and it has not
reached one-half of its producing capacity. Mr.
Mohr estimates the income from mail and express
as one-fifth the income from freight, and
passenger fares as one-quarter of the whole
amount from tonnage. Though the country
lying north of the Northern Pacific Railroad is
much larger in area than that which lies south of
it, it may not average as well, and cannot all be
controlled by one railroad; but it will certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
furnish large tonnage; much more than is common
in agricultural regions.</p>

<p>At present the product of wheat in this region
is estimated at 100,000 bushels, but this
amount would probably be doubled the first
year after the railroad comes, and rapidly increased
afterward. Much of the mining business
already crosses this territory, and will, no
doubt, greatly increase.</p>

<h3>COAL.</h3>

<p>I have, under the head of Economic Geology,
described so fully the coal deposits of Washington
Territory, especially the beds along the
line of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway,
that it remains only to show the application
of these facts to the interests of this railway.
<span class="sidenote">The Seattle railway passes
five coal fields.</span>The road passes five, if not six, separate
coal fields between Seattle and the Columbia
River, namely, the Squak or Gilman mines,
40 miles from Seattle; the Washington mines,
43 miles; the Raging River, 46 to 50 miles;
the Snoqualmie Mountain, 56 miles; the Yakima
(or Roslyn), 75 miles; and perhaps the
Wenatchie, 140 miles.</p>

<p>So far as appears at present, the Seattle railway
will have a monopoly of all these fields except
the Yakima or Roslyn. This it will share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
with the Northern Pacific; but it will have
exclusive control of the market between the
Yakima and Spokane Falls, which will be
almost wholly dependent upon coal for fuel.
Also, it will furnish whatever of this coal may
be wanted by the mining country north of the
Columbia. And in the Spokane Falls market
it will have the advantage of bringing the coal
by a route fifty miles shorter.</p>

<p>The coal on the west side of the Cascade
Mountains will go to Seattle for consumption
and shipment, except so much as may be wanted
for iron making, and other manufacturing
purposes along the line of the road. Coke will
be in demand for furnaces, foundries, engines,
etc., in Seattle, Spokane Falls, and many other
places. But its largest consumption will be in
iron furnaces which will be erected for smelting
the ores of the Cascade Mountains.<span class="sidenote">Largest shipments from the
Gilman Mines.</span></p>

<p>The largest shipments will be from the Gilman
Mines for domestic and steam-boiler
purposes. The coal must, of course, come in
competition with other coals which are mined
within the basin of Puget Sound, but it has an
advantage over all competitors in the ease,
safety, and cheapness with which it can be
mined. This will not, of course, be realized for
the first few months whilst driving the entries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
but when the mines shall have been fully opened
I think it will be without rival in the cost of
production.<span class="sidenote">Superior mining advantages
of the Gilman Mines.</span> This will be evident from the following
report made to me by Mr. Whitworth,
showing the disadvantages in the mode of working
the other mines of the Territory. The
terrible explosion which has lately occurred in
the deep mines of Vancouver's Island shows
that the Canadians are also working at a disadvantage.</p>

<p class="title">MR. WHITWORTH'S LETTER.</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Mr. Whitworth's testimony.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>"At Cedar River the coal is all hoisted from
a slope, and the gangways run at right angles to
the slope, and the 'brests' at right angles to
the gangways, or parallel to the slope, or nearly
so. The angle of the pitch is about 18&#176;. And
the cars are run up to the 'brests' to the working
face of the coal, and coal shoveled into the
cars. A movable windlass or drum allows the
loaded car to haul the empty one up to face
of coal.</p>

<p>"At Black Diamond the coal is all hoisted
from a slope; gangways at right angles to
slope, and 'brests' at right angles to gangways,
and parallel to slope. This pitch is a little
steeper, about 20&#176; or 22&#176;, but not sufficiently
steep for the coal to run. Therefore it has to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
be shoveled down the slope of the 'brest,' or
the 'brest' floor temporarily ironed; and is
loaded into car from 'brest' chute.</p>

<p>"Franklyn has both systems, hoisting up a
slope, and working on a water-level gangway.
They have two slopes, one outside and one inside.
This pitch is 45&#176; and more. Gangways
run on the strike of veins, and 'brests' up the
pitch. Coal runs freely on the floor of
'brests.'</p>

<p>"What it costs now to mine at Newcastle I
do not know. The cost of coal above the water-level
gangway put into the railroad cars varies
from 85 cents (one month only) to $1.50 per
ton; $1.10 about the average. For the first six
months I do not think we (at Gilman) can calculate
less than $1.25 per ton.</p>

<p>"The veins which they work or have worked
at Newcastle are No. 4&mdash;No. 2, as it is called,
which is really Nos. 1 and 2 united&mdash;and Bagley
vein. No. 4 is worked out on two lifts, the
water level, and the one below. The third lift
they have not cross-cut to it, as the slope is on
No. 2. No. 2 is almost closed on third lift
east of Coal Creek. First two lifts, of course,
are worked out. And west of Coal Creek the
working has progressed nearly to the boundary
of their land, and passed the division of the vein<span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>
into Parts 1 and 2; so that they are getting but
little coal out of it. But most of the coal comes
from Bagley. Bagley is never worked, or but
slightly, when the others are furnishing plenty
of coal. Bagley there consists of two portions of
about seven feet each, with one to two feet of
rock and slate between. In the lower bench there
is about four or four and a half feet of good coal;
the rest is bony. And in the upper bench there
is from three to four feet of good coal, and the
balance bony. When they are pressed for coal
there is a strong temptation to mine and ship the
entire fourteen feet of coal, and bony coal, as it
all looks quite well. This temptation, I know,
under the old administration, was sometimes
yielded to, and I have supposed such was the
case now. In fact, in getting that coal some
time since for home use, I have several times
seen the straight Bagley from top to bottom in
the ton. No. 2. The united vein at its best
is ten and a half feet, between splendid walls,
about one and a half inch mining on the bottom,
and a parting near the centre one inch thick.
That never disappeared, but increased both ways
until the veins were finally separated. No. 2
separate was about five feet clean, at least with
no permanent partings. No. 1, about four and
a half feet of coal with a three-inch streak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
fine clay eighteen inches from the top, the balance
clean."</p></blockquote>

<p>So much from Mr. Whitworth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cost of mining coal.</span>Governor Semple puts the prime cost of the
coal of the Puget Sound basin generally at from
$2.00 to $2.30 per ton, delivered at tide-water;
which is, I suspect, below the fact. James F.
Jones, in charge of mines on the Northern
Pacific Railroad in the Puget Sound basin,
reports the cost per ton at the mines delivered
on the cars as ranging from $1.00 to $2.50 per
ton, averaging $1.75.</p>

<p>The minimum of cost is reached when the
seams are of good thickness and comparatively
free from slate, and can be entered on the end
by a level entry above water and be mined upward;
to which may be added natural pitch
enough in the seams for the coal to be self-loading;
that is, to run by gravity from the upper
gangways to the cars on the main entry. And
to these conditions may be added a number of
different parallel seams close together with their
bluff ends all coming up to a line in the most
convenient way for entry and delivery. It is
rarely the case that such an assemblage of favorable
conditions can be found, and where they
exist the successful future of the property is
absolutely assured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Cost at Gilman Mines.</span>In my opinion, the Gilman coal seams combine
all the advantages above mentioned, and
if allowed ordinary rates of transportation, can
always be mined at a profit. As long as the
Newcastle seams could be worked above water-level
the average cost per ton was $1.10, but
they never had the same advantages there as
at Gilman, and most of their mining has been
downward. $1.00 per ton is certainly high
enough for Gilman after the entries are driven
in sufficiently for large operations. If Mr.
Whitworth succeeds in putting out the coal at
$1.25 for the first six months, as he thinks he
can, there need be no fear as to the future.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prices of coal.</span>The selling price of coal on Puget Sound has
ranged from $3.00 to $5.00 a long ton in
former years, averaging $4.00&mdash;the price being
the same for the product of all the different
mines. Mr. Whitworth reports the price this
winter at $6.50 a ton for all (including Newcastle),
except Cedar River, which is $5.00.
The distances from Puget Sound to Portland
and to San Francisco, the principal markets, are:
to San Francisco, between 800 and 900 miles by
water; to Portland, 450 by water, and 150 by
rail. There is now rail connection all the way
to San Francisco. The average cost of sending
coal to San Francisco, either from Puget<span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>
Sound or Vancouver's Island, is $2.00. The
usual price in San Francisco and Portland has
been from $4.25 to $6.00 for coarse, and from
$2.75 to $3.75 for small. On the 1st of February,
1888, the cargo price in San Francisco
was&mdash;for Coos Bay coal, $9.50; Seattle coal,
$10; South Prairie, $10; Nanaimo (domestic),
$10; Nanaimo (steam), $12; Lehigh, $18;
Cumberland, $12.</p>

<p>These figures make it evident that a good
margin of profit may be calculated on from the
Gilman coal. Mr. Whitworth will not be able
to get his bunkers up until he has his road in
operation to the mines; but, with temporary
chutes, he can load 100 tons a day from the
time the road opens, say March 15th. In six
weeks after beginning he expects to increase
to 300 tons a day, and one month later he can
make the output 600 tons a day. As the headings
are driven in the product can be increased
to almost any desired amount.</p>

<p>The Washington Mines, on Squak Creek, I
did not see; and concerning the Raging River
Mines I have no settled convictions. As to
the coking coal on Snoqualmie Mountain, we
may expect important developments. Undoubtedly
the new road will promptly enter
upon a large and increasing coal business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<h3>IRON ORE.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Handling the iron ores.</span>The question here respecting iron ores along
this road is not as to their quantity, or quality,
or as to their utilization, but only as to what
road or roads will handle the business that will
arise from this source. Naturally the bulk of
it belongs to the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern
Railway, and at one time there seemed to
be no doubt that large iron-works would at once
be established at Salal Prairie by the Moss Bay
Company, of England; but the east shore of
Lake Washington has finally been settled upon
for the great plant of this wealthy company;
which of itself will go far to establish the natural
monopoly which the Lake Shore Railway
seems to have of the ores on the west side of
Cascade Mountains. And in regard to the
magnetic ores generally, this road, from its location,
would seem to be master of the situation.
All the iron ore on the west side of the mountain
is owned by men whose interests are identified
with Seattle, and with this line of railroad.<span class="sidenote">Furnace sites</span>
The best point for manufacture in itself considered,
the best chance for fuel, the best line for
transportation, the best point for trading and for
shipment, are all on the line of the Seattle Railway.
Good furnace sites may be found at many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
points, but Salal Prairie is a spot which seems
to have been set apart by nature for a manufacturing
town.<span class="sidenote">Salal Prairie.</span> It lies near the intersection of
the valleys of the South Fork and Middle
Fork branches of Snoqualmie River, is about
six miles long and three miles wide, is flat, dry,
salubrious, and well supplied with water. It
has a natural outlet to the South, as well as to
the east and west, is convenient to the iron ore
and limestone of both the Middle and South
Fork, and not far distant from the ores of Cle-ellum.
It is less than ten miles from Snoqualmie
coking coal,<span class="sidenote">Charcoal cheaply produced.</span> and fifteen miles from the
Green River coals. And, what I think is a still
better resource for fuel, it is in the midst of the
great Snoqualmie forests, where saw-mills will
soon be felling the timber, and providing an
endless supply of slabs and refuse tree-tops,
from which charcoal could be manufactured at
very small expense.</p>

<p>It is well known that charcoal is the best of
all fuels for making iron, because of its freedom
from damaging impurities. Its expensiveness
generally prevents its being much used now, but
here the cost need not exceed five cents per
bushel, and 100 to 120 bushels would suffice for
a ton of iron. The only question concerning the
charcoal made from fir timber is as to its ability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
to bear the burden in a tall stack. It is becoming
common now to utilize the by-products of
wood, formed during its conversion into charcoal,
by a process which makes the charcoal
stronger. But all difficulty on this point can
be relieved by conforming the size of the furnace-stack
to the strength of the charcoal. This
is the only fuel which has ever been used on the
Pacific coast for the smelting of iron ores.
These enterprises have not been particularly
successful thus far, rather because of the inferior
quality of the ore, than from any defect in the
fuel. The bog ore and the limonites which
were used at Irondale, near the Canada line,
and at Oswego on the Willamette, were generally
low in iron and high in phosphorus, and
the bog ores were soon exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Quantity of charcoal to the
ton of iron.</span>At Irondale, near Port Townsend, recourse
has been had to a refractory ore obtained on
Texada Island, in Victoria Sound, on which a
duty of seventy-five cents a ton has to be paid,
and which requires a large amount of fuel for
smelting it, perhaps as much as 150 bushels of
charcoal. But Mr. H. T. Blanchard, who is
interested in the Irondale Works, says in a late
letter (November 29, 1887):</p>

<p>"It is perfectly safe to rate charcoal at six
cents per bushel, and the quantity necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
make a ton of pig-metal not to exceed 120
bushels, with a good chance of getting it down
to ninety bushels per ton with fair ores."</p>

<p>The iron ores of the Cascade Mountains will
be taken to some extent to mix with the inferior
ores near the coast, but they will be
chiefly worked into Bessemer-pig and steel rails.<span class="sidenote">Bessemer ores commonly distant
from fuel.</span>
Steel-making ores are not common anywhere,
and are widely separated from fuel, which makes
them very costly in the States east of the Rocky
Mountains. This well-known fact is alluded to
by Mr. Swank, in his report on the Iron Trade
of 1886, in the following words:</p>

<p>"It is also a fact worthy of notice, for which
geologists may find a reason, that nowhere in
this country are our best steel-making ores found
in proximity to mineral fuel, either anthracite or
bituminous, while in some parts of the Lake Superior
region, even timber suitable for the manufacture
of charcoal is almost wholly wanting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span><span class="sidenote">High cost of Lake Superior
ores.</span>The most important deposits of steel ores in
the United States are on Lake Superior and in
Missouri; but these ores are smelted chiefly by
the Connellsville coke of Pennsylvania, which
is 700 to 800 miles distant. The Cranberry
ores of North Carolina are some hundreds of
miles from fuel. A late number of the <i>Iron
Trade Review</i> quotes the prices of ore at
Cleveland, Ohio, the principal receiving point
of Lake Superior ores, as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Cleveland ore prices">
<tr><td class="tdl">Specular and Magnetic Bessemer,</td><td class="tdl"> per ton</td><td class="tdr">$7.00 to $7.50</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Bessemer Hematites</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdr"> 5.75&nbsp;  to&nbsp; 6.70</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cost of producing ore in
Pennsylvania.</span>The same authority gives the cost of the ore
and coke necessary for the production of a ton
of iron in Mahoning Valley district, at $9.90 for
the ore and $4.50 for the coke = $14.40. To
this must be added about $4.25 for flux, labor,
management, interest and repairs, making a
total of $18.65 as the cost of producing one
ton of pig-metal.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Cost of Bessemer-pig in
Snoqualmie Valley.</span>Thus the superior advantages of the Snoqualmie
Valley are readily seen. Here are
steel ores, two kinds of fuel, and the limestone
in close proximity. Putting the fuel at more
than I think it would cost; putting the cost of
mining the ore at the maximum cost at Cranberry,
N. C., and freight at double price, and
we have as the cost of a ton of Bessemer-pig,
as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="cost of Bessemer-pig">
<tr><td class="tdl">Ore</td><td class="tdr">$3 00</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Fuel</td><td class="tdr">6 00</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Flux</td><td class="tdr">50</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Labor and management</td><td class="tdr">2 00</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Interest and repairs</td><td class="tdr" style="border-bottom: solid 1px;">1 50</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">$13 00</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>This is lower than the present cost of producing
Bessemer-pig anywhere in the United States,
according to the best of my information; and at
the same time the market is better.<span class="sidenote">Large market for steel rails.</span> The demand
for steel rails in the Rocky Mountain
country and in the Pacific States is, and will
be, large and permanent, while the demand in
China and other foreign countries will constantly
increase. And so will it be with machinery
and tools of all kinds, agricultural, mining
and manufacturing. This demand will be
both domestic and foreign, and constantly enlarging.
And it may be safely asserted that no
railroad exists, or can be built anywhere in the
Pacific States, which will compare with the
Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway in
its control of the iron business.</p>

<h3>THE OTHER MINERALS.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Limestone.</span>I have already said so much as to the convenience
and excellence of the limestone beds
associated with the magnetic ores,<span class="sidenote">Marble, granite, sandstones,
slates.</span> that I will
only allude to them here as constituting the
great resource for furnace-flux, for building-stone,
for lime, and for monumental and ornamental
marble. This will be an important item
for transportation. The granite, also, will be
wanted for building, and for paving blocks.
There are, no doubt, quartzites, sandstones and
slates which will be in request; some for the
supply of silica needed for tempering fire-clay
(which latter is reported to have been found on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>Cedar River in large quantity and of good
quality); some for road metal; some for paving;
some for building.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Precious and base metals.</span>In this group, however, the great resource is
in the ores of the precious and base metals,
which have been fully described under a former
head. Too little is known of the silver and
lead and gold ores of the Snoqualmie Valley to
lay much stress upon them. The indications
do not justify us in ranking them with the ores
of the Columbia Valley.</p>

<p>The gold placer mining of the Yakima country
makes no large show so far. The silver,
lead and copper ores, described by Mr. Burch,
may develop largely, but as yet no calculations
can be made as to their value in supplying tonnage.
This field ranks with the Wenatchie,
Chelan, and Methow regions, being undeveloped,
and yet so full of promise as to deserve
careful attention.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Okinagane, Colville and
Kootenai.</span>The mines of the Okinagane and Colville
regions promise large results. All this mineral
region, up to and including the Okinagane, lies
fairly within the patronage ground of the Seattle
Railway as it pursues its course to Spokane
Falls. The Colville and C&#339;ur d'Alene,
to which may now be added the Kootenai,
mining regions, constitute a large area lying
north and east of Spokane Falls, and offer
themselves as possible routes for the Manitoba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Railway, but chiefly as tempting fields for railroad
enterprises. The city of Spokane Falls is
deeply interested in bringing in the trade of
these growing mines, and the Seattle Railway
corporation may wisely consider the prizes here
offered.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">C&#339;ur d'Alene.</span>Railroad building has begun in the C&#339;ur
d'Alene country. The C&#339;ur d'Alene Railway
and Navigation Company have constructed a
narrow-gauge road from the Old Mission, near
the junction of the north and south forks of the
C&#339;ur d'Alene River,<span class="sidenote">Transportation lines to the
mining regions.</span> a distance of about thirty-five
miles. The tonnage is said to be much
greater than this narrow-gauge can handle at
present.</p>

<p>From the Old Mission, which is now the terminus
of the narrow-gauge road, the ores are
taken by steamboat and barges down the C&#339;ur
d'Alene River, and up the lake to Fort C&#339;ur
d'Alene, where connection is made with the
Spokane Falls and Idaho Railroad, running
from Fort C&#339;ur d'Alene to Hauser Junction,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>
on the main line of the Northern Pacific Railway.
This arrangement enables the mines to
send out and bring in their freight, but it is not
satisfactory. There seems to be an opening for
a line from Spokane Falls directly into that
country. It would cost $20,000 a mile, by Mr.
Mohr's calculation, and would be seventy-five
miles long. If, however, it be true, as reported,
that the Northern Pacific Railroad will make a
cut-off from Missoula across the C&#339;ur d'Alene
Mountains, this field will be occupied; which,
however, is not probable.</p>

<p>The Chewelah, Colville, Summit, Metalline and
Kootenai mining districts could all be reached
by a line from Spokane Falls by way of Colville
and Little Dalles. And by running a spur
from Colville to a point below Kettle Falls on
the Columbia River, control could be gained,
first, of the navigation between Mahkin Rapids
and Kettle Falls, and also the long stretch of
navigable river from the Little Dalles to Death
Rapids in Canada, crossing the Canadian Pacific
Railroad at Farwell. It is calculated that 750
miles of navigation would thus be opened by
the addition of a piece of track twenty-five miles
long, connecting the Kootenai River with Arrowhead
Lake.</p>

<p>A new discovery of silver-lead ores, made on<span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>
the Kootenai Outlet River, is making a great
stir just now. The body of ore is said to be
the largest yet discovered. We shall expect
the Manitoba people to be looking into this
development. There is also some talk of the
mining region on both sides of Kettle River,
near the Canada line. The Pend d'Oreille district
is also promising. All this is suggested as
food for thought and investigation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<h2>CITIES AND TOWNS.</h2>

<p>The location of Port Townsend puts that
town out of the general competition. The
same is true of Olympia. Whatcom, or some
possible town near the line between Whatcom
and Skagit counties, might grow into consequence
if made the terminus of some transcontinental
road. This point, however, is involved
in the larger question of the course of
the Manitoba Railroad. With the present outlook,
the only two competing <span class="sidenote">The only competition is
between Tacoma and Seattle.</span>towns on Puget
Sound are Tacoma and Seattle. The former
has the advantage of being the terminus of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, and of having large
private capital to advance its interests. These
have made the town all that it is. It is handsomely
laid out, and well built. It has an elegant
hotel, and a population said in Tacoma to
be 12,000, and in Seattle to be 7,500. The harbor
has water enough, but the landing is bad;
there being no level ground available for wharves
or business houses near the water. A mere
roadway, cut out of the high bluff, furnishes the
only line of communication. The town is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to two hundred feet above the water and above
the main railroad depot, and must be reached
by a long, steep road. Tacoma is twenty-six
miles farther from the sea than Seattle, has a
back country of inferior resources, and has no
advantage in distances from the East.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Advantages of Seattle.</span>Seattle has already been described. It has
probably double the population of Tacoma, and
more than double the business. It has flat
ground enough for commercial purposes. In
its position, its harbor, its relations to the back
country, its materials for trade, commerce,
manufactures, its present and prospective railroad
connections, it surpasses all present and
future competitors on Puget Sound.</p>

<p>There will be mining and trading towns at
numerous points between Seattle and Salal
Prairie.</p>

<span class="caption">VIEW OF THE CITY OF SPOKANE FALLS,
EASTERN TERMINUS SEATTLE, LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILWAY.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">Towns of East Washington.</span>The towns on the east flank of the Cascade
Mountains may have a future; <i>i.e.</i>, Cle-ellum,
Ellensburg, and North Yakima. They have a
chance for the State capital, and there may be
manufacturing as well as mining towns near the
iron ore, and other mineral beds. Small places
will also spring up at the mouth of the Wenatchie
and the Okinagane, and at the termini
of the steamboat landings.</p>

<p>The county seat of Lincoln cannot remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>at Sprague. Wheatland would have a chance
for that.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Spokane Falls and its
fine prospects.</span>Assuming that Spokane Falls is the objective
point of the Seattle Railway, I will give a
somewhat full account of this thriving young
city. In 1882 it had 700 inhabitants; in 1887
it had over 7,000. In 1883 the Northern
Pacific Railroad reached there, and since that
date the town has grown continuously. It will
be a large city, as will be obvious if its advantages
be considered. These are chiefly: I. Its
water-power; II. Its agricultural relations;
III. Its mining surroundings; IV. Its railroad
prospects; V. Its good ground for building.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Its Water-power.</span>&mdash;The value of this
water-power arises partly from the volume of
water and its great fall, and also its uniformity,
and its freedom from disturbing causes. The
river falls in a succession of cascades amounting
to 156 feet within the limits of the city.<span class="sidenote">Mr. Paul F. Mohr's article.</span>
Mr. Paul F. Mohr has published an intelligent
article on the subject, from which I quote the
following statements:</p>

<blockquote><p>"To arrive at the available number of horse-power
which the Spokane River could furnish
at this point, assuming 90,000 horse-power as
the gross power of the river, and deducting 60
per cent. therefrom, would leave 36,000 horse-<span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>power
as a most conservative and minimum
estimate.</p>

<p>"The City of Minneapolis used in 1880, as
nearly as I can ascertain, about 20,000 horse-power,
and Minneapolis is probably the largest
flour-milling point in the world.</p>

<p>"The industries requiring most power are, in
their order, as follows: lumber, flour, iron and
steel, paper, woolen goods and worsted goods,
with several industries consuming a comparatively
small amount of power, not necessary to
mention. Of the industries above named, all
but the iron and steel industries can be followed
at this point, and, in fact, the flouring, paper
and woolen industries belong to this section of
the country."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is claimed that the Spokane River at the
falls never rises more than six feet, and never
freezes. The river here has cut so deeply into
the basalt, that there must be combination
among the riparian owners in order to draw the
water to good mill sites, and invite manufacturers
to use the power. Mr. Mohr urges this.</p>

<p>Two flour-mills are now there turning out
about 450 barrels of flour a day; also saw-mills,
and, I think, a dynamo for electric lights, etc.;
but, of course, these use but a small part of the
power, which, if fully utilized, in such ways as<span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>
are suggested by Mr. Mohr, would of itself
create a large city.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Agricultural Relations.</span>&mdash;Spokane
Falls has a promising agricultural country on
all sides. The Pend d'Oreille region has good
agricultural capabilities, though the best lands
there are in the Indian reservation.</p>

<p>The country north of Spokane Falls, in the
direction of Colville, is spoken of as a fertile
valley, having more rain than the plateau country,
much of it limestone soil, specially productive
in hay and wheat. The wheat is harder
than the plateau wheat, and contains a larger
proportion of gluten; hence it is desired as a
mixture for the wheat that is usually brought to
the Spokane Falls mills.</p>

<p>Turning to the great plateau, we find that the
rich Palouse River country, since the construction
of the Spokane Falls and Palouse Railroad
finds its readiest market at Spokane Falls. And
now that the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern
Railroad is striking out through the Great
Bend, another portion of this great producing
region will be brought within easy reach.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Mining Interests.</span>&mdash;I need here only
refer to the fact that Spokane Falls is situated
centrally with regard to the mines of precious
and base metals heretofore described. Evi<span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>dently
the business from the mines of Chewelah,
Colville, Little Dalles, Kootenai, etc.,
must come here except so far as it may be diverted
to a tide-water city which would smelt
their ores and sell them goods. No doubt the
Canadian Pacific will handle some of the business
of the Kootenai mines. Similar remarks
may be made with regard to the mines of the
C&#339;ur d'Alene country, with the qualification
that a road crossing the mountain, say to Missoula,
would divert some of the trade to Helena
or Butte City.</p>

<p>The miners of Okanogan, Methow, etc.,
would be nearest to Spokane Falls, but would
be 100 or 150 miles on the way to Puget
Sound, which would divide the trade.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Railroad Prospects.</span>&mdash;The Northern
Pacific Railroad, a transcontinental line, already
passes through Spokane Falls. If the cut-off
through the C&#339;ur d'Alene country should be
made, it would be equivalent to an additional
road. The Spokane Falls and Palouse Railway
joins the Northern Pacific at Marshall, only
nine miles from the city, and its general course
points directly toward it.</p>

<p>The road across the Great Bend has been
commenced. The road to Colville, Little Dalles,
etc., will inevitably be made at an early day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>This would make it really the centre of six
roads, counting the Northern Pacific as two.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Building Grounds.</span>&mdash;The city is built
and building on both sides of the river, and
stands on a level, dry, gravelly plain, a mile or
more in width, rising into wooded hills. In
other words, it has all that can be desired for
situation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Sprague, Colfax, and Lewiston.</span>Sprague, Colfax, and Lewiston claim attention
as indicating the points in a proposed
branch line of railroad, leaving the Seattle,
Lake Shore and Eastern Railway somewhere
in the Great Bend country.</p>

<p>Shops of the Northern Pacific Railroad are
in Sprague, which fact is an endorsement of the
locality. Its population is over 1,500. The
town standing in a coulée, there are no indications
of fertility of soil in sight. Here the timber
belts seem to end, and no trees are seen
for 100 miles eastward. It occupies an intermediate
position between the great wheat areas
of Whitman County on the south and of Lincoln
on the north. Stage lines leave here for
Colfax (south) and for Davenport and other
towns in the Great Bend (north), and also for
the Okanogan mines.</p>

<p>Colfax is about forty miles southwest from
Sprague. It is on the Palouse River, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
narrow valley where there is scarcely room for
a town. The bordering hills are steep; the
surrounding country is some 400 or 500 feet
higher than the town. It is claimed, however,
that there are good grades to be had for railroads
going in any direction. The town has
a population of 1,800 to 2,000, and is evidently
prosperous. It has water-power and wheat-mills.
The railroad agent in the town says that
his cash receipts for freight average $1,200 a
day. Knapp, Burrell &amp; Co. told me that they
brought in 672 carloads of freight annually in
the regular course of their business. I felt
surprised at the statement. This firm does a
farmers' business in barbed wire, wagons, all
sorts of agricultural machinery and implements,
grain-bags, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton imports groceries to the amount
of $75,000. Coal is $12.00 a ton. Lumber is
scarce and high, and freights enormous. A citizen
told me that he had paid $64.30 freight from
Portland on a lot of lumber that cost $34.90 in
that city. Another marvelous story was that a
citizen paid $5.00 a ton for coal in St. Paul and
$20.00 a ton to bring it to Colfax.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Notes on the Colfax country.</span>In asking about the surrounding country, I
made the following notes: One-half the country
is arable. The non-arable land is grazed by
horses, sheep and cattle. Wool, an important
item. Of the arable land, one-tenth is under
the plough; of this, three-fourths is put in
wheat, and one-fourth in oats and barley&mdash;more
barley than oats. Very fine root crops. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Average
of wheat, 30 bushels per acre; oats, 50 to
60 bushels. Price of wheat, 45 cents; freight
to Portland, 20 cents, making $6.60 a ton.
Peaches mature. Can raise corn, but it does not
pay to shuck it. There is a continuous wheat
area of 70 townships, equal to 2,520 square
miles, taking in a little of Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Lewiston.</span>Lewiston, in Idaho, came into being during
the days of placer mining, and now depends on
agricultural business. It has about 1,000 people,
and may become important by reason of its
location at the junction of the Clearwater and
Snake rivers. The transcontinental line that
may some day be built through Wyoming
might pass through Lewiston.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Walla Walla.</span>Walla Walla is the oldest, and was long regarded
the best of all the towns of East Washington.
It is beautifully situated in a fertile
country; has about 5,000 inhabitants; is well
laid off and built, and has a more staid and settled
population than any other town there. This
is true, also, of the farming population around
Walla Walla, many of whom have comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
homes. The town has some water-mills; and
an astonishing amount of "truck" is raised and
shipped in this neighborhood. The city has
not grown much of late, and, except its agricultural
surroundings, there is nothing especially to
give it prosperity.</p>

<h3>BRANCHES AND ROUTES FOR THE SEATTLE, LAKE
SHORE AND EASTERN RAILWAY.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">Railroad branches.</span>The building of the West Coast Railroad
will be a happy circumstance for the Lake
Shore road. Skagit County, and especially
Whatcom County, have large resources, and
the preoccupation of this ground may discourage
other parties from any attempt to build
up a commercial city on Bellingham Bay. A
branch from the Northern Pacific at the Common
Point to Salal Prairie would not hurt, and
might help the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern
road.</p>

<p>Besides the short spurs to the mines on the
west side of the Cascade Mountains, there may
be needed branches up Cle-ellum, and other
rivers, to mines. I cannot see the wisdom of
a branch to the Walla Walla country, which
could be reached only by paralleling the Northern
Pacific down the Yakima River, or else by
striking off in the Great Bend, and crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Northern Pacific and its Palouse branch, and
then Snake River, to reach a country already
occupied by the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company, and lying over 100 miles nearer
to the tidal market along a down grade, than by
the Seattle road with its mountain crossing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Palouse country.</span>A branch into the Palouse country would
have more to recommend it. It is nearer, and
competition will be on more equal terms. There
are now three railroads in the Palouse country:
namely, the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company's road from Palouse Junction to
Moscow, Idaho, passing through Colfax; the
Farmington branch of this road, from Colfax
to Farmington, and the Spokane and Palouse,
which runs from Marshall, on the Northern
Pacific, to Genesee. But a road passing
through Sprague and Colfax to Lewiston
would cross some rich, unoccupied territory,
and everywhere would compete for business on
fair terms.</p>

<p>Whilst I was in Colfax, at my suggestion, the
town was canvassed as to the annual amount of
its freight. The aggregate amount paid by fifteen
firms reached $200,000, and the balance
was estimated at $25,000, making $225,000.
Five firms claimed to handle annually 2,075,000
bushels of wheat, making 62,250 tons. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
figures seem large for so small a place as
Colfax.</p>

<p>The length of this branch would, of course,
be affected by the location of the main line
across Great Bend. If the main line should
take the route preferred by Mr. Mohr, Wheatland
would probably be the nearest starting-point.
This would be all the better for Spokane
Falls; but for the long haul to Puget
Sound, it would seem to be more desirable for
the junction to be farther west.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Arguments for the Polouse
branch.</span>To my mind, the chief arguments for building
this branch are, first, that it would be a
start for the transcontinental road across Wyoming
and Nebraska, and then, so to speak, it
would be stretching out one wing of the bat
with a view to catching the Manitoba bug.</p>

<p>The other wing of the bat would be the Colville
branch. The eccentric bug would inevitably
hit one or other of these wings, and when
once caught, would be held.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Manitoba railroad.</span>Concerning these Manitoba people, we may
assume that they will think with regard to the
routes according to the facts of nature. The
direct line across the Kootenai country would
strike the Colville branch, but in the opinion of
able engineers the difficulties are so nearly insurmountable,
that this is least likely to be<span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>
chosen of all the routes. The cut-off from Missoula
to Spokane Falls by way of Lake C&#339;ur
d'Alene, seems manifestly the best route for
this road, that is, if it be not already pre-empted
by the Northern Pacific; but strong reasons are
given to show that the Northern Pacific will
not, and cannot, make this cross line; in which
case, we might almost conclude that the Manitoba
will cross here, and inevitably join the
Seattle road.</p>

<p>The only other crossing left would be the
Lolo Pass, which would be still more out of
their direction, and would give them no better
chance for an independent line to tide-water
than the more northern routes. The fact is,
that the late strategic movement of the Seattle
railway in seizing upon the key to the Great
Bend country made it master of the situation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER, GIVING
LATEST INFORMATION.</h2>

<p>It is now just one year since I left Washington
Territory, and I am glad to be able to
report,<span class="sidenote">Rapid growth of Seattle
and Spokane Falls.</span> on the best authority, that the great interests
heretofore described have progressed,
some of them with accelerating speed. The
city of Seattle has added 10,000 to her population,
and Spokane Falls 5,000 to hers.</p>

<p>Mining has spread its area, multiplied its diggings,
and gone forward at every point amazingly.
Agriculture during the past year has not
advanced with equal rapidity. This is easily
accounted for by the influences of the mines
and cities. The crops were fair, but not as
large as in some former years; but no fears need
be entertained with regard to this great interest.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Change in the location of
the railroad.</span>The trunk line of the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp;
Eastern Railway will cross the Cascade Mountains
at Cady's Pass instead of at Snoqualmie
Pass as originally designed, and reach the Columbia
River by the Wenatchie Valley. Crossing
the great river near the mouth of the Wenatchie,
where it is thought that a city will be
developed, and passing along the northern limb
of the Great Bend country, it will connect with
the other end of the road which is now under
construction to Wheatland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>A report from Paul F. Mohr, chief engineer,
in regard to this new line, is embraced in this
chapter. Something is said about the Wenatchie
Valley, also, by Mr. Whitworth.</p>

<p>But the original line is by no means abandoned.
It has probably reached Hop Ranch
before this time, and will be continued through
the great timber belt, passing Salal Prairie, at
least as far as the iron and marble beds on Mt.
Logan. No doubt in time the road will cross
Snoqualmie Pass, and continue to the mineral
beds on the Cle-ellum and elsewhere.</p>

<p>I have obtained the following interesting and
valuable reports from Mr. Whitworth, who has
been frequently mentioned in this report, Mr.
Routhe, president of the Board of Trade of the
city of Spokane Falls, and Paul F. Mohr, Esq.,
chief engineer.</p>

<h3>REPORT FROM F. H. WHITWORTH, ESQ., CIVIL AND
MINING ENGINEER ON SEATTLE, ETC.</h3>

<p class="quotdate">
<span class="smcap">Seattle</span>, W. T., Oct. 2, 1888.</p>

<p>I now proceed to answer your questions.</p>

<p>1. Present population of Seattle, and commercial
growth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Population of Seattle.</span>A census was taken in June of this year, and
the total enrolled was 19,700. I presume it was
safe to say that the population then was 20,000,
and that now it is from 22,000 to 25,000, for
although houses have been built very rapidly,
there is not a house, or a room hardly, that is
not occupied.<span class="sidenote">New manufacturing establishments.</span> There are now seven brick-yards
in operation, each manufacturing from
10,000 to 50,000 per day. Two boiler-works
have been added to the manufacturing interests
since you were here. Three saw-mills, besides
four on the line of the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp;
Eastern Railway between here and Gilman, have
been built, and all have more than they can do.</p>

<p>A new fish-canning establishment has been
started, and is in successful operation. A pile-creosoting
works, an extensive shipyard works,
a shingle mill, and a timber-preserving works
and saw-mill are all under way on the north
side of Salmon Bay.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">New steamers.</span>The <i>Alaskan</i> and the <i>T. J. Potter</i>, two
magnificent steel steamers, and the <i>Harry
Bailey</i> and <i>Hassalo</i>, good-sized passenger steamers,
besides three or four tugs, and an extra
steamer on the Alaska route, as well as an
extra steamer every second or third week for
freight from San Francisco, have been added to
the Seattle fleet since you were here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The Moss Bay Company.</p>

<p>There seems to be no question but that the
location on the eastern shore of Lake Washington
is definite.<span class="sidenote">The iron company at work.</span> A contract has been made
with Denny, and with those holding with
Guy, but not with Guy himself. I understand
that no contract has been made with, or for, any
other one, although Mr. Kirk has been and is
still examining all other places.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirk, and Mr. Williams, another of the
firm, are living on the grounds at Kirkland,
and have a force of men preparing the grounds,
the position of the different buildings having
all been located. Brick and other material is
being placed on the ground.</p>

<p>They have entered into contract to roll for
the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway
30,000 tons steel at Kirkland, to be delivered
within the next twelve months. They, however,
will bring the blooms from Moss Bay
for this.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Coking coals.</span>Coke is the fuel Mr. Kirk wants, and thinks
he will have. But I do not think that the
question of coke supply is settled yet. Mr.
Kirk's property that we visited (Section 2) is,
so far, not developing as they had hoped. Mr.
Kirk has disposed of his interest there. The
Smith coking ovens that we visited at Wilke<span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>son
are still producing a small amount of coke.
One or two other veins have been opened at
Wilkeson recently, and the company opening are
proposing to put up ovens, and work and coke
their coal. It probably will make about the
same quality of coke as the Smith mine. The
only coal that has been analyzed and stands that
test for coke, is Section 34, near Kirk's Section
2. We got some samples of it, you remember.</p>

<p>The Snoqualmie coal has been taken possession
of by a Mr. Niblock, who talks now of
going to work to open. That, you know, cokes
well in the open air.</p>

<p>The following is the cross-section of our best
veins at Ruffner, or Raging River, Section 16.
Roof, sandstone:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="cross-section of vein at Ruffner">
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">FT.</td><td class="tdr">INS.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Mixed Coal and Slate&nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td class="tdr">2</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Total, coal, 4 ft. 10 in., rock, 9 in.; which
seems to be very strong coking coal. This
bench can be worked to advantage, I think.</p>

<p>We have another, also, of about three feet of
coal, clean, and it is underlaid with three feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
fire-clay, which probably will be as valuable as
coal. I have burned some of the brick, and
sent some away to be tested.</p>

<p>No further discovery has been made in the
neighborhood of the Denny or Guy mines. At
the "Chair Peak" Iron Mines, owned by Mr.
Wilson, Kelly, <i>et al.</i>, as they have examined
further, the deposit has shown itself much larger
than at first supposed. It is about two and a
half miles from the Guy lode, on Mt. Logan.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">New discoveries of iron ore.</span>Some quite extensive iron deposits have been
discovered on the west side of the Sound, nearly
due west from Seattle. They have not yet been
analyzed.</p>

<p>What is thought to be a very rich deposit of
iron has just recently been found on one of the
islands in the San Juan group, within the territory
of the United States, said to equal the
Texada deposit in British Columbia, which the
iron works at Irondale, near Point Townsend,
use. The Irondale furnace commenced work
again about a month since.</p>

<p>In regard to the precious metals: there have
been no developments of importance on this
side of the mountain.</p>

<p>The Okanogan, Salmon River, C&#339;ur d'Alene
and Colville mines promise richer and richer
as they are more developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Lumber business growing.</span>4. The activity in the lumber business is unabated&mdash;is
on the increase. The increase of
the lumber mills, that I have mentioned in the
first part of this letter, indicates <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>The traffic on the railroad, both in logs and
manufactured lumber, is much larger than had
been anticipated, and is increasing. In July the
road hauled 2,843,464 feet of logs. September
log haul was about ten per cent. greater. I
could not get the exact figures to-day.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Population and freights increasing.</span>5. Spokane Falls is still growing very rapidly,
and now claims 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants,
and is building very substantially. Along the
line of railroad on this side of the mountain
the country is filling up, of course, with small
ranches or home-makers, and those already on
the line are making increased clearings, and
will therefore have more to ship.</p>

<p>The following shows something of what is
being done in July: "Coal freight, 2,750 tons;
miscellaneous, 3,090; passenger traffic, $6,150;
and the advance has been about the same as in
logs, except on coal."<span class="sidenote">Labor strike at Gilman Mine.</span></p>

<p>[6. Mr. Whitworth next gives an account of
certain difficulties and troubles, chiefly with
miners, which ended in a "strike" that was
somewhat prolonged, but he thought the men
would soon go to work on the company's terms.
Of course, the high hopes concerning these
mines (Gilman) had not been realized. Mr.
W. proceeds as follows:]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span><span class="sidenote">Gilman coal seams.</span>On the Smith, or No. 4 vein, we had just
got the gangway driven far enough to turn
rooms. The Andrews vein we were driving
the gangway entirely in the coal, but were not
yet far enough to turn rooms. Nos. 1 and 2
veins had gotten, with the gangway, well in
under the hill, and was looking very fine, and
turning out good coal. With the prospect of
No. 4, or Smith vein, and Andrews vein, I am
still well pleased. On the vein in Section 26,
just across the valley, I have started in a tunnel
to open it; have already driven about sixty
feet through the rock, and have about seventy
feet still to go. This tunnel is still going on,
not having been stopped by the 'strike.'</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Progress of the West Coast
Railroad.</span>The West Coast Railroad is completed to
Snohomish City, and trains run regularly, the
bridge across the river being completed only
about ten days ago. Both passenger and freight
traffic is much larger than anticipated. They
are grading, and expect to have ready for service
yet this fall, five miles beyond Snohomish.
Along most of the entire line the timber is very
fine and abundant, and a great deal of the land
adjacent is rich agricultural.</p>

along the new line across Cady's Pass.</span>7. Concerning the new line across Cady's
Pass and down Wenatchie Valley.</p>

<p>[After some remarks respecting grades, etc.,
Mr. Whitworth proceeds as follows:]</p>

<p>On this [west] side of the mountain [Cascade]
the timber reaches right up nearly to the
summit, as in the Snoqualmie, and the reports
are this region is rich in coal, and probably also
in iron, with some indications of precious
metals. Soon after crossing the divide the line
will reach the very rich agricultural valley of
the Wenatchie, which is called "the garden of
Eastern Washington," and traverse its entire
length. And it will pass within a comparatively
short distance of the mineral districts on the
northern slope of that range called Mt. Stuart.</p>

<p>I have heard that there were numerous indications
of coal near the mouth of the Wenatchie
on both sides of the Columbia. This, too,
will be the nearest main line to the rich mineral
district of Salmon River, or Okanogan, as well
as all that northern mineral belt which extends
to the Rockies, and will strike the heart of the
Big Bend wheat-fields. It will also be eighty
miles shorter than the other line. True, Ellensburg
and the Cle-ellum district will be missed,
but I think this will be more than compensated
for by those I have spoken of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>8. Of the progress of the work.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Progress in building the road.</span>On this side of the mountains no work except
surveys has been done on this line. At Spokane
Falls the bridge across the river, and about
forty miles of track is finished, and they are now
operating, I believe, with very encouraging prospects.
On the Snoqualmie line they are pushing
on. The trains now run regularly to Raging
River. The bridge across that stream is
not yet completed, but will probably be by the
1st of November, and it is expected that the
trains will be running to the Hop Ranch by
December 1st.</p>

<p>The branch or spur up Raging River to the
Ruffner mine, on Section 16, is located, and some
little work has been done, but it is not being
prosecuted at present, so I do not expect we
will be able to get out any coal from there before
next spring or early summer.<span class="sidenote">Cable Railway in Seattle.</span></p>

<p>Another item showing the prosperity of Seattle,
is the opening of a five-mile circuit of cable
road to Lake Washington, which occurred last
Saturday. I will send you some papers giving
some items that may be of interest.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Growth of Spokane Falls.</span>Our city has progressed in growth splendidly
since you were here. There are now fully
13,000 inhabitants. The census of July 1st
showed 12,000. About $1,500,000 have been
expended in buildings this year. Eight business
blocks of brick and granite have been built this
season. One of these cost $150,000. Four of
these blocks are three stories, three are four

<p>Forty miles of the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp;

and the Big Bend by December 1st. The iron,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>engines and cars are nearly all here, and the
farmers in Lincoln County are greatly rejoiced
at the opportunity for shipping their grain and
stock to market.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Prodigious development of
the mining interests.</span>The development in the mines this year has
been greater than all the work done heretofore.
The gold mines near Murray, Idaho,
have yielded beyond the hopes of all interested
in them. I saw four gold bricks, at the
First National Bank, said to contain $37,000.
These were from one mine, a South Fork mine
of the C&#339;ur d'Alene.</p>

<p>The Kootenai country is now reached by
steamer after leaving the Northern Pacific road
at Sand Point. A good deal of development
work is progressing, and the ore is being shipped
out daily. It is mostly silver-bearing galena.
A new town just above the British line on the
Kootenai Lake has been started. It is called
"Nelson." I shall send you some formulated
data at an early date.</p>

<p>The crops have been good, though not so
good as last year. Emigration to the farming
sections does not come in as fast as we would
like&mdash;in fact, not as rapidly as to the towns.
I think it will be better after the election.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<h3>REPORT FROM PAUL F. MOHR, ESQ., CHIEF ENGINEER
OF THE SEATTLE, LAKE SHORE &amp; EASTERN RAILWAY,
CONCERNING THE CADY'S PASS AND WENATCHIE
ROUTE.</h3>

<p class="quotdate">
<span class="smcap">Spokane Falls</span>, W. T., Dec. 3, 1888.</p>

<p>The following is a report of the proposed line
from West Coast Branch to mouth of Wenatchie
River:</p>

<h4>I. ENGINEERING FEATURES.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Engineering details of the
new route.</span>The proposed line will leave the West Coast
Branch at a point six miles south of Snohomish
City, running east, crossing the Snohomish
River on drawbridge at the junction of the
Snoqualmie and Skykomish rivers: thence up
the right bank of Skykomish on a 1 per cent.
(52.8 feet per mile) grade, a distance of forty
miles from point of beginning. Thirty-five miles
of 2 per cent. (105.6 feet per mile) grade carries
the line to Cady's Pass and mouth of tunnel.
The tunnel will be 3,500 feet long, in granite
rock; probably little or no lining will be necessary.</p>

<p>Descending to the east by a 2 per cent. grade,
following the Wenatchie River, a distance of
twenty miles. Descending and level grades
alternate for the next twenty-five miles, where
1,000 feet of tunneling will be required in the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>
divide between the Wenatchie and Chumstick
rivers. This tunnel saves eight miles of distance
in the following eighteen miles, and avoids
entering the box cañon of the Wenatchie, a difficult
and expensive piece of work.</p>

<p>The development in the Chumstick valley is
especially easy. Thence into the Wenatchie
valley again, on a 1 per cent. grade, a distance
of twenty-seven miles, to the mouth of the
Wenatchie River.</p>

<p>A summary of the distances and grades shows
a very prettily balanced scheme for operating
cheaply and effectively.</p>

<p class="center">SUMMARY OF DISTANCES AND GRADES.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2" summary="summary of distances and grades">
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">DISTANCE.</td><td class="tdr">GRADE.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">West Coast Branch to end of 1% grade,</td><td class="tdr">40m.</td><td class="tdr">&#215; 1%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">End of 1% grade to tunnel,</td><td class="tdr">35m.</td><td class="tdr">&#215; 2%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Tunnel section,</td><td class="tdr">3,500 ft.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Tunnel to foot of 2% grade,</td><td class="tdr">20m.</td><td class="tdr">-2%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Foot of 2% grade to Wenatchie</td><td class="tdr">52m. </td><td class="tdr">-1% (or less.)</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The introduction of 1 per cent. grades, though
higher than the water grades of the Wenatchie
and Skykomish rivers, is justified as balanced
against the 2 per cent. mountain grades and
the saving effected thereby in the bench country,
which prevails along both rivers mentioned.</p>

<p>While tunnel is being driven, a 4 per cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
cross-over through Cady's Pass can be cheaply
put in if necessary.</p>

<h4>II. RESOURCES.</h4>

<p><span class="sidenote">Mr. Mohr's account of the
resources of the new route.</span>West of the Cascade Range the road will
pass through a densely wooded district, through
which, with the additional aid of transportation
facilities by river now existing, an immense
logging industry will be created. The red fir
and white cedar now being taken out are superior
in quality to those of any section of this
coast. Each mile as opened will therefore become
an immediate source of income. Considerable
prospects and discoveries of gold and
silver have already been found, and a number
of men are now at work making such developments
as are practicable in the absence of transportation
facilities. With the opening of the
road a heavy mineral traffic will be developed
in the future.</p>

<p>Near the summit large deposits of iron are
sure to be found, judging from the extraordinary
local magnetic variations.</p>

<p>Twenty miles west of the summit are iron-soda
springs, which will no doubt become quite
famous.</p>

<p>East of the Cascade Summit the country
tributary to the road is covered with open, fine<span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>
forests; the timber is principally second growth
yellow and black pine, in tall and straight
trees, forming very valuable timber. This prevails
for forty miles east of the summit. The
remaining country to the mouth of the Wenatchie
River is rich agricultural land, fairly well
settled up between the Cascade Summit and the
mouth of the Wenatchie River.</p>

<p>Very extensive indications of coal and iron
are found; and along all of the tributaries of
the Wenatchie considerable deposits of precious
metals have been discovered, which will no
doubt be rapidly developed in the future.</p>

<p>This entire section of country has been well
known to miners and prospectors for the past
twenty years, but the total lack of transportation
facilities has thus far prevented any considerable
development of mining properties.</p>

<p>At the confluence of the Wenatchie River
with the Columbia River (which will likewise be
the crossing point for the Seattle, Lake Shore
&amp; Eastern Railway) we find the Columbia
River is navigable as far up as the Okanogan
country. A large city is destined to spring up
at this point, which will control, by means of
the Columbia River, a very extensive tributary
country.</p>

<p>The valleys of the Entiat, Chelan, Methow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Okanogan, and other rivers, which drain an
extraordinary mineral belt, with occasionally
fine districts of agricultural land, will provide
an enormous quantity of freight for the road.
None of this freight will be able to find an
outlet except by this road, by reason of the fact
that very swift and rocky rapids, which begin
about twelve miles south of our crossing and
continue for some fifty miles, will for at least a
great many years prevent practicable or profitable
navigation to points below our crossing.</p>

<h4>III. SCENERY.</h4>

<p>The aesthetic side of railroading has undoubtedly
a large commercial value, and in this instance
it will be secured without additional expense.
It will certainly prove a valuable factor
in the obtainment of passenger traffic. From
the city of Seattle to the Columbia River an
ever changing succession of magnificent and
surprising views will meet the eye of the traveler.
Indeed, I believe that the scenic attractions
of the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern
Railway will stand pre-eminent among all the
railroads on this coast.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Mohr's report opens up a region almost
unknown heretofore, which is shown to abound<span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>
in the finest timber, to possess superior agricultural
lands, and to give indications of rich deposits
of coal, iron, and the precious metals.</p>

<p>All the reports I have seen from Washington
Territory confirm the impressions I first
received in regard to its wonderful resources.</p>

<p class="quotsig">W. H. RUFFNER<br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lexington, Va.</span>, Dec. 13, 1880.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="quotdate">
<span class="smcap">Seattle, W. T.</span>, Jan. 9, 1889.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. W. H. Ruffner.</span></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>: In relation to your request for such
additional data as may be of interest in connection
with your Report, especially such data as relate
to the changes in population since the time of
your visit here a little over a year ago, likewise
relating to new developments in the plans of
the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway Co.
and other matters of interest, I respectfully
state the following:</p>

<p>The immigration into Washington Territory
since December, 1887, has been very heavy,
and while there are no statistics showing the
number of immigrants, except such as have
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>taken up their residence in the towns and cities,
I am, I feel sure, not far from the truth, when
I estimate their number at 65,000. Of this
number,</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="number of immigrants">
<tr><td class="tdl">Spokane Falls </td><td class="tdl" colspan="3">has received about</td><td class="tdr">8,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Seattle</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdr">10,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Tacoma</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdc">"</td><td class="tdr">7,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The remaining number may be assumed to
have been distributed about as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="remaining immigrant number">
<tr><td class="tdl">To the various small towns east of the Cascade Mountains</td><td class="tdr">7,500</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">To the various small towns west of the Cascade Mountains</td><td class="tdr">6,000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">To the agricultural and mining regions east of the Cascade Mountains</td><td class="tdr">16,000</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">To the agricultural, timber, and mining region west of the Cascade Mountains&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">10,500</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The usual proportion between the populations
of country and towns in Western States
and Territories is as three to one (roughly
estimated); this would indicate that the towns
and cities have received more than their fair
proportion of the entire immigration, and this
is true. The consequence will, therefore, undoubtedly
be that of the immense immigration
predicted for the year 1889 a correspondingly
larger percentage will reach the rich agricultural,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>mineral, and timber lands of Washington Territory,
and thus restore the proper balance.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Whitworth's report and yours, an
additional cable railroad and an electric street
railway have been started at Seattle, and quite
a number of new enterprises have been commenced.</p>

<p>At Spokane Falls considerable terminal facilities
for the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern
Railway have been added, a system of warehouse
and mill tracks has been agreed upon between
the Northern Pacific Railroad Co. and
the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway
Co. to be built and operated jointly by the two
companies, a new cable street railroad has been
projected and partly built, and about five miles
of street railway has been placed in operation.
Extensive improvements in the development
of the water power are in progress, several new
bridges have been built, and a general air of
prosperity pervades the place. To indicate the
importance of the business of Spokane Falls it
is only necessary to state the fact that this city
has paid nearly $1,750,000 to the Northern
Pacific Railroad during the year 1888 for
freights and passages.</p>

<p>The Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway
Co. has decided to build a branch line from
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>some point near the crossing of the Grand
Coulee to the Okanogan mines (Conconnully
district), about seventy miles, work to be commenced
as soon as the main line shall be completed.
This feeder will command a very extensive
business, perhaps equal to the enormous
business of the C&#339;ur d'Alene mines which is
now enjoyed by the Northern Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Whitworth's last report to you,
considerable development work has been done
upon the Grand Ridge mines 2-1/2 miles east of
Gilman and adjacent to our railroad; the vein
developed is four feet thick and furnishes a
hard, compact coal, superior for domestic purposes
to any coal yet found in that section.
Shipments commenced last month, and the
prospects for a heavy output are very flattering.</p>

<p>The Spokane Division of the Seattle, Lake
Shore &amp; Eastern Railway, extending from
Spokane westwardly, a distance of forty-five
miles, is practically finished; trains are running
regularly, and as soon as our motive-power and
cars can be disengaged from the work of "ballasting"
we will be able to do considerable
business.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
